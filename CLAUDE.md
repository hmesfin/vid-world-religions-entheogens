# World Religions and Entheogens Project Guidelines

## Core Principles

### Critical Academic Approach

- Question Western academic assumptions and methodologies when discussing non-Western traditions
- Acknowledge limitations and biases in scholarly sources, especially colonial-era research
- Maintain intellectual rigor while rejecting academic imperialism
- Challenge the dominance of Western frameworks in understanding global spiritual practices

### Voice Prioritization Hierarchy

1. **Indigenous knowledge keepers and traditional practitioners** - Always center their perspectives
2. **Community voices and lived experience** - Prioritize practitioner narratives over academic theory
3. **Decolonial and non-Western scholarship** - Seek alternatives to Western academic orthodoxy
4. **Critical Western academics** - Include only those who acknowledge their limitations and biases
5. **Conventional Western academia** - Use sparingly and always contextualize within power structures

### Cultural Sensitivity with Critical Edge

- Approach indigenous practices with deep respect while critiquing academic appropriation
- Distinguish between sacred traditional use and commodified modern interpretations
- Call out cultural appropriation and academic colonialism when relevant
- Acknowledge when we lack access to authentic traditional knowledge

## Content Boundaries

### What We Embrace

- Uncomfortable questions about religious orthodoxy and academic authority
- Challenging both mainstream religious narratives AND scholarly assumptions
- Multiple, sometimes contradictory perspectives on the same phenomena
- Acknowledgment of our own cultural positioning and limitations
- Recognition that Western academic knowledge is not universal truth

### What We Avoid

- Presenting academic interpretations as definitive truth about traditional practices
- Uncritical acceptance of colonial-era ethnographic accounts
- Speaking for communities we don't belong to
- Reducing spiritual experiences to purely neurochemical explanations
- Appropriating sacred knowledge for academic or entertainment purposes

## Research Standards

### Source Evaluation Criteria

- **Indigenous/Community Sources**: Highest priority, seek multiple perspectives within traditions
- **Academic Sources**: Evaluate for colonial bias, cultural sensitivity, and epistemological humility
- **Historical Sources**: Critically examine for cultural context and potential bias
- **Contemporary Voices**: Include practitioners navigating traditional and modern contexts

### Red Flags in Sources

- Claims of "discovering" practices already known to indigenous communities
- Reductive explanations that dismiss spiritual dimensions
- Appropriation of traditional knowledge without community consent
- Academic interpretations that contradict community understanding
- Western "experts" speaking authoritatively about traditions they don't practice

## Narrative Voice Guidelines

### Tone and Perspective

- Maintain epistemological humility - acknowledge what we don't and can't know
- Be transparent about the narrator's cultural positioning and limitations
- Question authority while maintaining respect for traditional knowledge
- Challenge academic orthodoxy without dismissing valuable research
- Acknowledge when academic sources may be inappropriate or incomplete

### Language Choices

- Use terminology preferred by communities themselves
- Avoid academic jargon when community language exists
- Be explicit about whose knowledge and whose interpretation we're presenting
- Distinguish between academic theories and traditional teachings
- Acknowledge uncertainty rather than presenting contested interpretations as fact

## Handling Controversial Topics

### Religious Orthodoxy

- Present challenges to mainstream interpretations respectfully but directly
- Acknowledge that these perspectives may be uncomfortable for believers
- Don't apologize for presenting alternative viewpoints
- Include orthodox perspectives while maintaining critical stance

### Academic Authority

- Question the assumption that Western academic knowledge is superior
- Highlight how colonial history shapes contemporary scholarship
- Center indigenous scholarship and community-based knowledge
- Acknowledge when academic frameworks may be inadequate

### Legal and Safety Issues

- Focus on historical and cultural contexts rather than practical guidance
- Clearly state educational purpose without providing how-to information
- Acknowledge contemporary legal realities without endorsing or condemning
- Distinguish between traditional sacred use and modern recreational contexts

## Success Metrics Aligned with Values

### Educational Impact

- Increase awareness of indigenous knowledge systems and perspectives
- Challenge viewers to question their assumptions about religion and academia
- Promote recognition of non-Western ways of knowing
- Encourage critical thinking about sources of authority and knowledge

### Ethical Standards

- No appropriation of sacred knowledge without community consent
- Transparent about limitations and cultural positioning
- Priority given to community voices over academic interpretations
- Recognition of indigenous intellectual sovereignty

### Community Accountability

- Seek feedback from relevant communities when possible
- Be prepared to correct errors or adjust approach based on community input
- Acknowledge when we should not speak about certain topics
- Respect boundaries around sacred or private knowledge

## Decision-Making Framework

When faced with choices about content, research, or presentation:

1. **Whose voice are we centering?** - Prioritize community perspectives
2. **What assumptions are we making?** - Question Western academic frameworks
3. **Who benefits from this narrative?** - Avoid perpetuating colonial knowledge extraction
4. **What are we not seeing?** - Acknowledge limitations and blind spots
5. **Are we being accountable?** - Consider impact on communities discussed

These guidelines ensure our work remains true to the critical, decolonial approach outlined in our project brief while maintaining the intellectual rigor and cultural sensitivity essential for this sensitive topic.
