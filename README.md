# World Religions and Entheogens: Video Production Research

## Project Overview

This repository contains comprehensive research for a 30-45 minute YouTube video exploring the intersection of world religions and entheogens (consciousness-altering substances used in spiritual contexts). The project takes a critical academic approach that centers indigenous and community voices while questioning Western academic hegemony.

## Project Philosophy

This project explicitly:

- **Centers** indigenous knowledge keepers and traditional practitioners
- **Challenges** Western academic assumptions and colonial narratives  
- **Respects** sacred knowledge boundaries and community sovereignty
- **Acknowledges** the narrator's cultural positioning and limitations
- **Prioritizes** community benefit over knowledge extraction

## Research Phases

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Indigenous and Community Voices (Complete)

- Amazonian traditions (Shipibo, Yawanawa, Huni Kuin)
- Native American Church and peyote conservation
- Bwiti and African plant medicine traditions
- Cannabis in Rastafari and Hindu contexts
- Islamic mystical traditions and Sufism

### üîÑ Phase 2: Critical and Decolonial Scholarship (In Progress)

- Decolonial theorists on religion and knowledge
- Critical anthropologists examining their discipline's colonial history
- Non-Western scholars from affected traditions
- Indigenous academics writing about their own communities

### ‚è≥ Phase 3: Western Academic Sources (Pending)

- Critical evaluation of colonial-era sources
- Contemporary Western scholarship (with heavy contextualization)
- Identification of extractive or appropriative narratives

## Key Principles

### Voice Prioritization Hierarchy

1. **Indigenous knowledge keepers** - Always center their perspectives
2. **Community voices** - Prioritize lived experience over theory
3. **Decolonial scholarship** - Seek alternatives to Western orthodoxy
4. **Critical academics** - Include only those acknowledging limitations
5. **Conventional academia** - Use sparingly with contextualization

### Source Classification System

- **CENTER**: Indigenous/community voices to prioritize
- **CRITICAL USE**: Include with heavy contextualization
- **REFERENCE ONLY**: Mention but challenge
- **REJECT**: Exclude as inappropriate/harmful

### Sacred Knowledge Boundaries

This research respects that certain knowledge:

- Should remain within communities
- Requires explicit permission for sharing
- May be inappropriate for public dissemination
- Must not be commodified or extracted

## Target Audience

### Primary

- Those interested in comparative religion and consciousness studies
- Viewers seeking to understand these traditions beyond Western frameworks

### Critical Engagement

- Active religious practitioners who may find alternative interpretations challenging
- Conservative communities who may feel uncomfortable with the content
- Traditional academics resistant to decolonial approaches

## Ethical Commitments

1. **No Appropriation**: We do not speak for communities we don't belong to
2. **Community Benefit**: Research should serve affected communities
3. **Transparency**: We acknowledge our limitations and blind spots
4. **Accountability**: We accept correction from community members
5. **Reciprocity**: We seek to give back, not just extract

## Current Status

- **Phase 1**: ‚úÖ Complete - Indigenous voices documented
- **Phase 2**: üîÑ Beginning - Critical scholarship research
- **Phase 3**: ‚è≥ Pending - Western academic evaluation
- **Production**: üìù Pre-production research phase

## Contributing
