## OPENING STATEMENT (0:45 - 1:30)

**[VISUAL: NARRATOR direct to camera, simple background]**

**NARRATOR:**
This is not a balanced story. There are not two sides to theft.

For seventy years, Western institutions—academic, medical, commercial—have extracted sacred knowledge from indigenous communities. From R. Gordon Wasson's betrayal of María Sabina to today's corporate patents on ancient medicines, the pattern remains unchanged: they take, they profit, we celebrate their "discoveries," and communities suffer.

We will name this what it is: ongoing colonialism.

**[VISUAL: Quick succession of images, 2-3 seconds each:]**

- Wasson's Life Magazine cover
- Patent document
- Retreat center price list ($5,000)
- Indigenous protest signs

## THE SABINA TESTIMONY (1:30 - 2:30)

**[VISUAL: Historical photo of María Sabina - held for 3 seconds]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
In 1955, R. Gordon Wasson, a banker from New York, convinced María Sabina, a Mazatec healer, to allow him into a sacred mushroom ceremony.

**[VISUAL: Life Magazine article - 2 seconds only]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
In 1957, his article "Seeking the Magic Mushroom" appeared in Life Magazine.

**[VISUAL: Contemporary Huautla de Jiménez - showing tourism impact]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Within months, Huautla de Jiménez was overrun.

**[VISUAL: Black screen]**

**[AUDIO: María Sabina's voice from historical interview, subtitled]**

**MARÍA SABINA** (archival audio):
"Before Wasson, I felt the saint children elevated me. After Wasson, I felt they had lost their purity. They won't work anymore. I was destroyed."

**[VISUAL: Contemporary indigenous protest footage]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
She died in poverty. Her community still suffers. Wasson became famous.

This is the pattern we're going to expose.

## SETTING THE STAKES (2:30 - 3:00)

**[VISUAL: Contemporary indigenous speaker, identified with name and nation]**

**INDIGENOUS SPEAKER 2** (Shipibo leader):
"They study our medicines in their laboratories. They sell our ceremonies in their retreats. They patent our knowledge in their courts. And then they arrest us for practicing our own traditions."

**[VISUAL: Split screen]**
**Left:** Indigenous ceremony (respectful, with permission)
**Right:** Clinical trial setting

**INDIGENOUS SPEAKER 2** (continued):
"This is not the past. This is happening right now."

**[VISUAL: Contemporary protest footage - Standing Rock, indigenous resistance]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
From the Amazon to the Native American Church, from Bwiti traditions in Africa to Rastafari practices criminalized worldwide—every sacred plant tradition faces the same colonial machinery.

**[VISUAL: Text cards in succession]**

"Extraction"
"Reduction"  
"Commodification"
"Criminalization"

**[VISUAL: FADE TO BLACK]**

**[TEXT CARD:]**
"What follows is the evidence."

## DIRECTOR'S NOTES FOR OPENING

### Visual Priorities

- Open with indigenous-created art (MAHKU), not Western imagery
- María Sabina photos shown briefly, respectfully, as evidence
- No psychedelic visual effects
- No mystical color grading
- Natural lighting and colors throughout

### Audio Design

- Indigenous voices unfiltered, clear, prominent
- No Western music
- Natural ambient sounds from communities
- Silence as powerful tool

### Pacing

- Quick cuts for colonial imagery (2-3 seconds max)
- Longer holds for indigenous speakers
- No smooth transitions between extraction and resistance (jarring is appropriate)

### Critical Elements Established

1. Indigenous voices define the problem first
2. Colonial extraction named explicitly  
3. Contemporary relevance emphasized
4. Viewer discomfort is intentional
5. No "both sides" framework

### What We're NOT Doing

- No mystical introduction
- No "wonder of psychedelics" framing
- No Western "experts" in opening
- No neutral academic tone
- No apologies for directness

This opening sets an uncompromising tone: We are documenting colonial violence, centering indigenous sovereignty, and refusing false balance. The audience should understand within three minutes that this will challenge their comfort and assumptions.
