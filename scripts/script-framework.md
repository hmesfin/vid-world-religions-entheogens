# Script Development Framework

## Core Narrative Principles

### Voice and Tone

- **Narrator Position**: Critical outsider with epistemological humility
- **Tone**: Unflinching exposure of colonial violence, deep respect for indigenous sovereignty
- **Language**: Direct, accessible, no academic jargon unless exposing its violence
- **Perspective**: "We" when acknowledging complicity, "They" when exposing extractors

### Narrative Arc (30-45 minutes)

#### Act 1: The Theft (10-12 minutes)

- Open with indigenous voices defining the problem
- Expose the colonial project from Wasson to present
- Document the harm (María Sabina as central example)
- Show continuity from missionaries to pharmaceuticals

#### Act 2: The Resistance (15-20 minutes)

- Center indigenous sovereignty movements
- Document communities reclaiming their traditions
- Expose ongoing extraction (retreats, patents, clinical trials)
- Show the "psychedelic renaissance" as colonial project

#### Act 3: The Liberation (10-12 minutes)

- Present indigenous-led futures
- Support for sovereignty not inclusion
- Call for reparations not reform
- End with indigenous voices defining solutions

## Script Structure Elements

### Opening Hook (First 90 seconds)

- Start with powerful indigenous testimony
- Immediately establish colonial violence
- No mystical imagery or psychedelic aesthetics
- Set expectation of discomfort for viewers

### Voice Hierarchy Implementation

1. **Indigenous speakers**: Direct to camera, full names, community authority
2. **Community members**: In their spaces, their languages (subtitled)
3. **Critical scholars**: Brief, supporting indigenous narratives only
4. **Western extractors**: Only as evidence of harm, heavily critiqued

### Visual-Script Integration

**When Indigenous Voices Speak:**

- Full screen, respectful framing
- Natural environments or chosen spaces
- No B-roll over their words
- Subtitles for indigenous languages, preserving original audio

**When Showing Extraction:**

- Quick cuts (2-5 seconds max)
- Split screens showing contrast
- Price tags and patent numbers overlaid
- Immediate pivot to consequences

**For Sacred Content:**

- Text cards explaining what cannot be shown
- Audio testimony over black or indigenous art
- Animation or metaphorical imagery
- Respectful absence as statement

### Transition Strategies

**Between Sections:**

- Indigenous music or silence (no Western compositions)
- Text cards with stark statistics
- Community footage as palate cleanser
- No fade to black (implies ending rather than continuity)

**Between Speakers:**

- Direct cuts, no dissolves
- Geographic/cultural context cards
- Contemporary timestamp reminders
- Power dynamic indicators

### Key Narrative Threads

#### Thread 1: The Sabina Tragedy

- Introduced early as emblematic
- Returned to throughout as measure
- Her testimony in her words
- Contemporary family perspectives

#### Thread 2: Patent Violence

- Specific examples with numbers
- Traditional knowledge → Corporate property
- Communities locked out of their own medicine
- Legal violence visualization

#### Thread 3: Sacred Boundaries

- What we're not showing and why
- Community protocols explained
- Respect as resistance
- Viewer discomfort as education

#### Thread 4: Economic Extraction

- Retreat costs vs local wages
- Conference tickets vs community poverty
- Pharmaceutical profits vs indigenous health
- Academic careers built on extraction

### Language Guidelines

**Always Say:**

- "Colonial extraction" not "cultural exchange"
- "Theft" not "borrowing"
- "Sacred medicine" not "drugs" or "substances"
- "Indigenous sovereignty" not "inclusion"
- "Liberation" not "reform"

**Never Say:**

- "Discover" (unless in quotes exposing the lie)
- "Shaman" (unless community uses the term)
- "Psychedelics" (when referring to indigenous medicines)
- "Primitive" or "ancient" (as qualifiers)
- "Both sides" (false equivalence)

### Fact Integration

**Statistical Breaks:**

- Costs comparisons displayed graphically
- Timeline of extraction events
- Map of extraction routes
- Death tolls from prohibition

**Legal Documentation:**

- Patent numbers on screen
- Court documents briefly shown
- Laws criminalizing tradition
- International conventions violated

### Audience Address

**For Religious Viewers:**

- Acknowledge this challenges orthodoxy
- Don't apologize for discomfort
- Connect prohibition to religious freedom
- Show indigenous Christianity syncretically

**For Academic Viewers:**

- Directly challenge their authority
- Question their ethics
- Expose their extraction
- Refuse their frameworks

**For Psychedelic Enthusiasts:**

- Confront their appropriation
- Challenge individual focus
- Expose their complicity
- Redirect to solidarity

### Pacing Principles

**Never Linger On:**

- Colonial imagery (2-5 seconds max)
- Western speakers (brief clips only)
- Extraction evidence (quick documentation)
- Individual experiences (community focus)

**Allow Time For:**

- Indigenous speakers (full thoughts)
- Community footage (breathing room)
- Sacred absence (respectful pause)
- Viewer processing (discomfort is OK)

### Script Review Checklist

For every page:
✓ Are indigenous voices centered?
✓ Is extraction being exposed not perpetuated?
✓ Are sacred boundaries respected?
✓ Is the narrator position clear?
✓ Does this serve liberation?

### Endings to Avoid

**Do NOT End With:**

- Hope for reform within existing systems
- Calls for "integration" or "inclusion"
- Western institutions as solutions
- Individual transformation focus
- False reconciliation narratives

**DO End With:**

- Indigenous sovereignty assertions
- Community-defined solutions
- Calls for structural change
- Reparations and land back
- Liberation as only goal

## Implementation Notes

1. **First Draft**: Focus on indigenous voices and sequence
2. **Second Draft**: Add transitional narration and context
3. **Third Draft**: Integrate visual cues and timing
4. **Community Review**: Before any finalization
5. **Final Draft**: Incorporate all feedback

The script must embody the same uncompromising commitment to indigenous sovereignty that guides our research. Every word either serves liberation or perpetuates extraction—there is no neutral language.

*This framework ensures the script serves indigenous sovereignty while exposing colonial violence with unflinching clarity.*
