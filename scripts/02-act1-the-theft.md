# Act 1: The Theft (3:00 - 12:00)

## Section 1: THE COLONIAL PROJECT (3:00 - 6:00)

### The Missionary Foundation (3:00 - 4:00)

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
The theft begins long before Wasson. For centuries, Christian missionaries systematically destroyed indigenous spiritual practices.

**[VISUAL: Historical document - prohibition laws]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
What they couldn't destroy, they criminalized.

**[VISUAL: Contemporary indigenous elder]**

**INDIGENOUS SPEAKER 4** (Bwiti practitioner, Gabon):
"The missionaries came first. They burned our temples, banned our ceremonies, called our medicines 'Satan's work.' Then came the scientists, saying the same plants were now 'interesting compounds.'"

**[VISUAL: Split screen]**
**Left:** Missionary burning sacred objects (historical photo, 2 seconds)
**Right:** Modern pharmaceutical lab

**INDIGENOUS SPEAKER 4** (continued):
"Different uniforms. Same violence."

### The Academic Extraction (4:00 - 5:30)

**[VISUAL: Harvard Botanical Museum - exterior shot]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Richard Evans Schultes. Harvard. The "father of modern ethnobotany."

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Translation: He took thousands of sacred plants from indigenous territories. They're still at Harvard.

**[VISUAL: Indigenous botanist in community setting]**

**INDIGENOUS SPEAKER 5** (Contemporary indigenous botanist):
"They call it 'preservation.' We call it theft. Those plants have spirits, relationships, protocols. In those drawers, they're prisoners."

**[VISUAL: Patent document - highlighting specific claims]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
The specimens Schultes collected? Now referenced in pharmaceutical patents worth billions.

**[VISUAL: Community in poverty - respectful, not exploitative]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
The communities who taught him? Still fighting for land rights.

### The Chemical Reduction (5:30 - 6:00)

**[VISUAL: Albert Hofmann in laboratory (historical footage, 3 seconds)]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
1958. Albert Hofmann isolates psilocybin from María Sabina's mushrooms.

**[VISUAL: Chemical structure diagram - 2 seconds]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
The sacred becomes a molecule.

**[VISUAL: Indigenous speaker]**

**INDIGENOUS SPEAKER 6** (Mazatec healer):
"You cannot isolate the spirit. When they took the medicine from the ceremony, from the land, from the community—they killed it. What they have in their pills is a corpse."

## Section 2: THE WASSON BLUEPRINT (6:00 - 9:00)

### The Betrayal Documented (6:00 - 7:30)

**[VISUAL: Wasson's personal letters - highlighted excerpts]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):

**[TEXT ON SCREEN - from Wasson's letter:]**
"We must work quickly before the traditions are corrupted by contact"

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Translation: Take the knowledge before communities can protect it.

**[VISUAL: Contemporary extraction - retreat center website]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Seventy years later, nothing has changed.

**[VISUAL: Indigenous youth activist]**

**INDIGENOUS SPEAKER 7** (Young Mazatec activist):
"Wasson created the template. Befriend us. Document everything. Publish without permission. Profit from the attention. Then move on to the next community."

**[VISUAL: Montage - book covers, academic papers, documentary posters]**

**INDIGENOUS SPEAKER 7** (continued):
"McKenna did it. Pollan does it. Every anthropologist, every documentarian, every retreat owner—they all follow Wasson's blueprint."

### The Tourism Invasion (7:30 - 8:30)

**[VISUAL: Huautla de Jiménez - 1950s photograph]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Huautla de Jiménez before Wasson.

**[VISUAL: Same location - contemporary tourist infrastructure]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Huautla de Jiménez today.

**[VISUAL: Price comparisons on screen]**

- Tourist ceremony: $500 USD
- Local daily wage: $5 USD
- Healing for locals: Denied

**[VISUAL: María Sabina's granddaughter]**

**SABINA'S GRANDDAUGHTER**:
"My grandmother healed people for free. Now her name sells ceremonies to tourists while our people can't afford medicine."

**[VISUAL: Tourist testimonial (brief, critical context)]**

**TOURIST** (2 seconds):
"It was so authentic, so primitive—"

**[VISUAL: Cut to indigenous speaker]**

**INDIGENOUS SPEAKER 8**:
"Authentic? They destroyed the authentic. What they buy is our poverty performed for their entertainment."

### The Academic Legitimization (8:30 - 9:00)

**[VISUAL: Academic conference - predominantly white panel]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Every year, conferences on psychedelics. Tickets: $500-2000.

**[VISUAL: Conference speaker list - highlighting lack of indigenous names]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Indigenous practitioners on the panels? Usually zero.

**[VISUAL: Indigenous healer outside conference venue]**

**INDIGENOUS SPEAKER 9**:
"They discuss our medicines inside. We're protesting outside. They call themselves experts. We've been practicing for thousands of years."

## Section 3: THE CONTEMPORARY EXTRACTION (9:00 - 12:00)

### The Pharmaceutical Takeover (9:00 - 10:30)

**[VISUAL: Compass Pathways corporate headquarters]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
2020. Compass Pathways goes public. Value: 1.3 billion dollars. Their product? Synthetic psilocybin. Their innovation? Nothing. They're selling María Sabina's medicine.

**[VISUAL: Patent document - highlighted sections]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
They're trying to patent the way indigenous people have used these medicines forever. Setting and setting? They call it "proprietary methodology."

**[VISUAL: Clinical trial recruitment poster]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Who's included in their trials?

**[VISUAL: Data visualization - trial demographics]**

- White: 89%
- Indigenous: <1%

**[VISUAL: Indigenous health advocate]**

**INDIGENOUS SPEAKER 10**:
"They steal our medicine, synthesize it, patent it, then sell it back to us—if we can afford it. Most of us can't. Meanwhile, we're still arrested for using the plants our ancestors gave us."

### The Retreat Industry (10:30 - 11:30)

**[VISUAL: Luxury retreat center marketing materials - quick cuts]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
The global ayahuasca tourism industry: estimated 100 million dollars annually.

**[VISUAL: Price list overlay on indigenous community]**

- 7-day retreat: $5,000
- Annual income in source community: $500

**[VISUAL: Indigenous community leader]**

**INDIGENOUS SPEAKER 11** (Shipibo leader):
"They built resorts on our sacred sites. They hire one person from our community—as a token. The rest of the money? It leaves."

**[VISUAL: Western facilitator in indigenous clothing (2 seconds)]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Western facilitators. Indigenous costumes. A performance of the sacred.

**[VISUAL: Return to indigenous speaker]**

**INDIGENOUS SPEAKER 11**:
"When we conduct ceremonies for our community, the police come. When they do it for tourists, it's a business."

### The Legal Violence (11:30 - 12:00)

**[VISUAL: Arrest footage - indigenous person detained]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Right now, indigenous people are in prison for practicing their traditions.

**[VISUAL: Courtroom sketches or documents]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
While pharmaceutical companies patent those same traditions.

**[VISUAL: Split screen]**
**Left:** Indigenous ceremony (respectful archival)
**Right:** Corporate boardroom

**INDIGENOUS SPEAKER 12** (Native American Church lawyer):
"The Supreme Court ruled against our religious freedom in 1990. They said peyote—our sacred medicine for thousands of years—wasn't protected. But now corporations can research it? Universities can study it? That's protected?"

**[VISUAL: Contemporary protest - indigenous-led]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
This is not history. This is happening now. Today. While you watch this.

**[VISUAL: Return to María Sabina photo - held for 3 seconds]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Every retreat, every clinical trial, every patent—they all trace back to this theft. And it continues.

**[VISUAL: FADE TO BLACK]**

**[TEXT CARD:]**
"But communities are fighting back."

## DIRECTOR'S NOTES FOR ACT 1

### Visual Strategy

- Colonial imagery: Maximum 3 seconds per shot
- Indigenous speakers: Minimum 10 seconds uninterrupted
- No beautification of extraction sites
- Contemporary relevance emphasized throughout

### Key Transitions

- From missionaries to scientists: Same violence, different uniform
- From Wasson to present: Unbroken pattern
- From academic to commercial: Escalating extraction

### Critical Points Established

1. Extraction is systematic, not individual
2. Academic legitimacy enables theft
3. Contemporary industry built on colonial foundation
4. Legal system perpetuates violence
5. Communities bear all costs

### Emotional Arc

- Begin with historical distance
- Build to contemporary urgency  
- End with active, ongoing violence
- Transition to resistance narrative

*Runtime: 9:00 minutes (Total: 12:00)*
