# Act 3: The Liberation (27:00 - 40:00)

## Section 1: REPARATIONS NOT REFORM (27:00 - 31:00)

### The Debt (27:00 - 29:00)

**[VISUAL: Data visualization - extraction timeline from 1950s to present]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Seventy years of theft. Let's calculate the debt.

**[VISUAL: Financial data scrolling]**

- Pharmaceutical patents derived from indigenous knowledge: $50+ billion
- Retreat industry built on indigenous practices: $1+ billion annually  
- Academic careers funded by extraction: Countless
- Communities compensated: <0.01%

**[VISUAL: Indigenous economist with charts]**

**INDIGENOUS ECONOMIST**:
"This isn't about charity. It's about returning what was stolen. Every patent, every retreat center, every research grant—they owe their existence to our knowledge."

**[VISUAL: María Sabina's family home - modest, present day]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Compass Pathways' market cap: 500 million dollars. María Sabina's family: Still in poverty.

**[VISUAL: Sabina's granddaughter]**

**SABINA'S GRANDDAUGHTER**:
"They ask us to be grateful for 'recognition.' We don't need recognition. We need reparations."

### Beyond Inclusion (29:00 - 31:00)

**[VISUAL: Conference panel with one indigenous token speaker]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
They offer us seats at their table.

**[VISUAL: Indigenous sovereignty advocate]**

**INDIGENOUS SPEAKER 24**:
"We don't want a seat at the colonial table. We want to flip the table. We want our own table. On our land. With our rules."

**[VISUAL: Visual contrast - corporate board meeting vs. indigenous council]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
They talk about "integrating" indigenous wisdom.

**[VISUAL: Indigenous elder]**

**ELDER**:
"You cannot integrate what you do not understand. You cannot honor what you commodify. Stop trying to include us in your destruction. Start following our leadership toward healing."

**[VISUAL: Indigenous youth collective]**

**YOUTH LEADER**:
"Inclusion means they remain in control. Liberation means we take back control. We're not asking for inclusion. We're demanding liberation."

## Section 2: THE PATH FORWARD (31:00 - 36:00)

### What Must End (31:00 - 33:00)

**[VISUAL: List appearing on screen as narrator speaks]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Here's what stops now:

**[TEXT ON SCREEN, building:]**

- Patents on traditional knowledge
- Criminalization of indigenous practices
- Academic extraction without consent
- Commercial exploitation of ceremonies
- White people leading "indigenous" retreats
- Medical models without traditional healers
- Conferences without indigenous leadership
- Research without community control

**[VISUAL: Indigenous legal advocate]**

**LEGAL ADVOCATE**:
"These aren't requests. These are minimum requirements for justice. And we have the international law to back us up."

**[VISUAL: UN Declaration articles highlighted]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Article 24. Article 31. Already agreed. Never implemented.

### What Must Begin (33:00 - 36:00)

**[VISUAL: Indigenous territories from above]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Land back. Not symbolic. Actual return of stolen territories.

**[VISUAL: #LANDBACK protest]**

**INDIGENOUS SPEAKER 25**:
"The medicine comes from the land. Healing the land means returning it to its protectors. That's us."

**[VISUAL: Community healing center]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Healthcare that centers indigenous healing systems.

**[VISUAL: Indigenous health practitioner]**

**HEALTH PRACTITIONER**:
"Imagine hospitals where plant medicines are legal. Where our healers work alongside doctors. Where ceremony is part of treatment. That's not radical. That's restoration."

**[VISUAL: Indigenous school]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Education that teaches the true history.

**[VISUAL: Indigenous teacher with students]**

**TEACHER**:
"Our children learn that Columbus 'discovered' America. That Western science 'discovered' our medicines. We're teaching them the truth: We discovered nothing needed discovering."

**[VISUAL: Community economic projects montage]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Economic systems that serve communities, not corporations.

**[VISUAL: Indigenous cooperative leader]**

**COOPERATIVE LEADER**:
"We're building economies based on reciprocity, not extraction. Where wealth means healthy communities, not individual accumulation."

## Section 3: YOUR CHOICE (36:00 - 40:00)

### For the Comfortable (36:00 - 37:30)

**[VISUAL: Direct to camera - narrator]**

**NARRATOR**:
If you're uncomfortable, good. Comfort maintains colonialism.

**[VISUAL: Various audiences - religious, academic, "psychonauts"]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
To religious communities: Your prohibition enables extraction. Sacred plants aren't the enemy. Colonialism is.

To academics: Your objectivity is violence. Choose a side. There's no neutral study of ongoing theft.

To the psychedelic community: Your individual journey means nothing if it doesn't lead to collective liberation.

**[VISUAL: Indigenous speaker direct to camera]**

**INDIGENOUS SPEAKER 26**:
"Stop reading about us. Start listening to us. Stop studying us. Start supporting us. Stop taking from us. Start giving back."

### The Non-Negotiables (37:30 - 39:00)

**[VISUAL: Indigenous leaders gathering]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
This isn't a dialogue. The terms are set by those harmed.

**[VISUAL: Multiple indigenous speakers, building intensity]**

**SPEAKER 27**: "Full decriminalization. Now."
**SPEAKER 28**: "Release all prisoners. Now."
**SPEAKER 29**: "Cancel all patents. Now."
**SPEAKER 30**: "Return the land. Now."
**SPEAKER 31**: "Pay reparations. Now."

**[VISUAL: Indigenous youth rally]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Not in stages. Not with conditions. Now.

### The Future We're Building (39:00 - 40:00)

**[VISUAL: Indigenous ceremony - joyful, community-centered]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
This isn't about returning to the past. It's about creating a future where the sacred is protected, not profitable.

**[VISUAL: Multiple indigenous communities, global]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
From the Amazon to the Arctic, from Africa to Australia, indigenous communities are connected, organized, and rising.

**[VISUAL: Indigenous elder with youth]**

**ELDER** (final words):
"For five hundred years, they've tried to destroy us, silence us, erase us. We're still here. Our medicines are still here. Our ways are still here. And now, we're taking them back."

**[VISUAL: MAHKU artwork - vibrant, powerful]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
The colonizers had their century. This one belongs to the indigenous.

**[VISUAL: Young indigenous child learning traditional practice]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
The question isn't if indigenous sovereignty will be restored. It's whether you'll support it or stand in its way.

**[VISUAL: Fade to indigenous-created art]**

**[TEXT CARD:]**
"Indigenous sovereignty is not a request.
It's an assertion.
The liberation has begun."
