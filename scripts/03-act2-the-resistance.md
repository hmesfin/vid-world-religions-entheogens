# Act 2: The Resistance (12:00 - 27:00)

## Section 1: RECLAIMING THE NARRATIVE (12:00 - 16:00)

### Indigenous Resurgence (12:00 - 14:00)

**[VISUAL: MAHKU art collective at work - vibrant, collaborative]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
But here's what Western media won't show you: Indigenous communities aren't victims. They're fighting back.

**[VISUAL: MAHKU paintings - full screen, respectful duration]**

**IBÃ HUNI KUIN** (MAHKU artist, subtitled):
"They took our visions and put them in museums. So we paint new ones. These paintings—they're not for sale to collectors. They're weapons. They show the world: this knowledge is ours."

**[VISUAL: Indigenous youth learning traditional practices]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Across the Amazon, young people are reclaiming what colonization tried to destroy.

**[VISUAL: Youth leader speaking at community gathering]**

**INDIGENOUS YOUTH LEADER** (Yawanawa):
"Our grandparents hid the medicine to protect it. Now we practice openly. Yes, the tourists come. But we control what they see, what they learn, what they take home. The deep knowledge? That stays with us."

**[VISUAL: Traditional ceremony preparation - respectful, with permission]**

**ELDER** (voiceover):
"For every retreat center stealing our ways, we have ten young people learning the true path. They cannot steal what lives in our hearts."

### Legal Victories and Ongoing Battles (14:00 - 16:00)

**[VISUAL: Courtroom exterior - Indigenous protesters outside]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
2021. The Native American Church wins a court case in Arizona. Small victory. The war continues.

**[VISUAL: Indigenous lawyer in office]**

**INDIGENOUS LAWYER**:
"We shouldn't have to prove our traditions in their courts. But we do. Every day. Fighting for the right to practice what we've done since before their countries existed."

**[VISUAL: Document - UN Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
International law recognizes indigenous rights to traditional medicines. National governments ignore it.

**[VISUAL: Split screen - multiple countries' arrest footage]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Brazil. Peru. United States. Canada. The pattern repeats.

**[VISUAL: Indigenous activist at UN]**

**INDIGENOUS SPEAKER 13** (UN Permanent Forum):
"They sign declarations. They take photos with us. Then they go home and continue the arrests, continue the patents, continue the theft."

## Section 2: EXPOSING THE "RENAISSANCE" (16:00 - 21:00)

### The Psychedelic Renaissance Decoded (16:00 - 18:00)

**[VISUAL: Michael Pollan book cover - 2 seconds]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
They call it a "psychedelic renaissance." Renaissance for whom?

**[VISUAL: Indigenous community member]**

**INDIGENOUS SPEAKER 14**:
"Renaissance means rebirth. Our traditions never died. We kept them alive despite their laws, their prisons, their persecution. This isn't a renaissance. It's a gold rush."

**[VISUAL: Investment conference - psychedelic companies]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
2020 to 2025. Over 5 billion dollars invested in psychedelic companies.

**[VISUAL: Data visualization - money flows]**

- To pharmaceutical companies: $4.8 billion
- To indigenous communities: <$10 million
- To fighting criminalization: <$1 million

**[VISUAL: Indigenous economist]**

**INDIGENOUS SPEAKER 15**:
"They're building an industry on our knowledge while we can't even get funding for cultural centers. That's not a renaissance. That's colonialism with better PR."

### Medical Colonialism in Action (18:00 - 20:00)

**[VISUAL: Johns Hopkins psychedelic research center]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Johns Hopkins. Imperial College. NYU. The prestigious institutions leading psychedelic research.

**[VISUAL: Research team photos - highlighting demographics]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Count the indigenous researchers. We'll wait.

**[VISUAL: Clinical trial participant (anonymous)]**

**TRIAL PARTICIPANT**:
"They gave me psilocybin in a hospital room. White walls. Classical music. A therapist who'd never taken the medicine himself. It helped, but... something was missing."

**[VISUAL: Indigenous healer]**

**INDIGENOUS HEALER**:
"Of course something was missing. The earth. The community. The songs that have guided these medicines for thousands of years. They extract the chemical and wonder why it doesn't fully work."

**[VISUAL: Patent filing documents - scrolling]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Meanwhile, every clinical trial generates data used for patents.

**[VISUAL: Indigenous data sovereignty advocate]**

**INDIGENOUS SPEAKER 16**:
"They're not just stealing our plants anymore. They're stealing our healing methods, our ceremonial protocols, even the way we prepare people. Then they rename it 'psychedelic-assisted therapy' and claim they invented it."

### The Individual Salvation Myth (20:00 - 21:00)

**[VISUAL: Western "psychonaut" social media posts - quick succession]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
The Western psychedelic movement preaches individual transformation.

**[VISUAL: Indigenous community ceremony - wide shot]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Indigenous traditions practice collective healing.

**[VISUAL: Indigenous philosopher]**

**INDIGENOUS SPEAKER 17**:
"They take medicines meant to connect us to each other and to the land, and they use them to optimize their individual performance. They miss the entire point. These medicines aren't for escaping society's problems. They're for seeing our role in fixing them."

## Section 3: SOVEREIGNTY IN ACTION (21:00 - 27:00)

### The Decriminalization Trap (21:00 - 23:00)

**[VISUAL: City council meeting - decriminalization vote]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Oakland. Denver. Oregon. They're decriminalizing plant medicines. Progressive, right?

**[VISUAL: Indigenous activist at city council]**

**INDIGENOUS SPEAKER 18**:
"Decriminalization for white communities while we're still being arrested. Decriminalization that opens the door for commercial extraction. That's not justice. That's apartheid."

**[VISUAL: Comparison chart]**

- Cities with decriminalization: 15
- Indigenous people still arrested annually: 1000+
- Corporate licenses granted: 50+
- Indigenous-owned licenses: 2

**[VISUAL: Indigenous organizer]**

**INDIGENOUS SPEAKER 19**:
"True decriminalization means: Drop all charges. Release all prisoners. Expunge all records. Pay reparations. Anything less is theater."

### Building Alternative Futures (23:00 - 25:30)

**[VISUAL: Indigenous-run healing center]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
While corporations build clinics, indigenous communities create their own healing spaces.

**[VISUAL: Community healing session - respectful, with permission]**

**INDIGENOUS PRACTITIONER**:
"We don't need their validation. We don't need their licenses. We have our own systems, our own training, our own accountability."

**[VISUAL: Indigenous youth in training]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Seven-year apprenticeships. Not seven-day certifications.

**[VISUAL: Young indigenous healer]**

**YOUNG HEALER**:
"They want to learn our medicine in a weekend workshop. It took me seven years just to begin. And I'm still learning from my grandmother."

**[VISUAL: Community economic project]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
Communities are also building economic sovereignty.

**[VISUAL: Indigenous cooperative leader]**

**COOPERATIVE LEADER**:
"We're creating our own economy. Growing our own food. Teaching our own children. Healing our own people. We don't need their system. We need them to get out of our way."

### The Real Medicine (25:30 - 27:00)

**[VISUAL: Land Back protest]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
The deepest medicine isn't in the plants alone.

**[VISUAL: Indigenous elder speaking to gathered community]**

**ELDER**:
"The medicine is the land. The medicine is the language. The medicine is the community. When they take the plants without these, they take a body without a soul."

**[VISUAL: Multiple indigenous speakers, rapid succession]**

**SPEAKER 20**: "Land back."
**SPEAKER 21**: "Sovereignty."
**SPEAKER 22**: "Reparations."
**SPEAKER 23**: "Liberation."

**[VISUAL: Contemporary ceremony - joyful, community-centered]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
This is what resistance looks like. Not asking for inclusion in their system. Building our own.

**[VISUAL: Indigenous youth dancing, celebrating]**

**YOUNG INDIGENOUS WOMAN**:
"They thought they could destroy us. They thought they could steal everything. But we're still here. The medicine is still here. And we're not going anywhere."

**[VISUAL: Sunset over indigenous territory]**

**NARRATOR** (V.O.):
The question isn't whether indigenous communities will survive. They will. The question is whether we'll stop the theft before it's too late.

**[VISUAL: FADE TO BLACK]**

**[TEXT CARD:]**
"Liberation is not negotiable."

## DIRECTOR'S NOTES FOR ACT 2

### Visual Priorities

- Resistance and joy, not just struggle
- Contemporary indigenous strength
- Community solutions in action
- Youth prominently featured
- Celebration alongside critique

### Narrative Balance

- Expose false solutions (decriminalization without justice)
- Center indigenous alternatives
- Show extraction as ongoing but not inevitable
- Present clear political demands

### Key Messages

1. Indigenous communities are not waiting for Western validation
2. The "renaissance" is colonial extraction rebranded
3. Medical models strip medicines of essential context
4. Individual transformation without collective liberation is meaningless
5. Sovereignty, not inclusion, is the goal

### Emotional Arc

- From resistance to strength
- From critique to alternatives
- From individual to collective
- From survival to thriving
- Building to liberation framework

### What We Avoid

- Portraying indigenous communities as victims only
- Suggesting Western systems can be reformed
- False hope in corporate psychedelics
- Individual transformation narratives
- Reconciliation without reparations
