# Cannabis in Rastafari and Hindu Spiritual Contexts: Research Notes

## Executive Summary

This research document focuses on cannabis use in Rastafari and Hindu/Shaivite traditions, prioritizing practitioner and community voices as requested. The research reveals a complex landscape of sacred religious practices, colonial suppression and criminalization, contemporary legal struggles for religious freedom, and ongoing debates about sacramental versus recreational use.

**Key Findings:**

- Rastafari practitioners across all three mansions (Nyabinghi, Bobo Ashanti, Twelve Tribes) regard ganja as a sacred sacrament essential to their spiritual practice
- Hindu Shaivite traditions have used cannabis (bhang, ganja) for thousands of years in religious contexts, particularly in devotion to Lord Shiva
- Pre-colonial cannabis traditions in both India and Africa were systematically suppressed by colonial powers and missionaries
- Contemporary legal battles continue as practitioners fight for religious freedom and protection from criminalization
- Women's voices remain significantly underrepresented in available documentation
- Internal community debates exist about maintaining traditional boundaries while defending religious rights
- Economic justice issues emerge around who profits from legalization versus who was criminalized

## 1. Rastafari Perspectives on Sacramental Ganja

### Rastafari Elder Testimonies and Direct Voices

#### **VOICES TO CENTER** - Rastafari Legal Advocates and Elders

**Elder Kamau Janai (Starscape Rastafari Sanctuary)**

**Source Classification: CENTER** - Lead elder and former Cannabis Licensing Authority board director

**Testimony on Religious Freedom**:
> "We are still appealing to the police high command, the commissioner himself, to just give us some attention. We would like to have a dialogue with him and his team to understand and build a relationship with the Rastafari community... because at the end of the day, we are all here [on] Jamaica, land we love. Give us our freedom and liberty to use our ganja."

**Community Authority**: Represents Rastafari communities in Manchester, St Elizabeth, Westmoreland, and Hanover

**Ras Iyah V (Verald Vassell) - Ganja Activist and CLA Board Director**

**Source Classification: CENTER** - Long-term Rastafari rights advocate (since 1987)

**Testimony on Constitutional Rights**:
> "You know, because from even before the 2015 amendment, based on the United Nations Charter, Constitutional Fundamental Human Rights, and the Jamaican Constitution, our rights as Rastafari were continuously being violated for having herbs in our possession. So we're calling on the Government, again and again, to educate our police so that they stop harassing Rastafari. Ganja is a part of [the] Rastafari and Jamaican culture, like athletics, like football, like any other thing; it's a part of Jamaican culture."

**Historical Perspective**: "So we are saying that it's time that Rastafari enjoy our constitutional rights and stop being harassed by the police."

**Ras Byah (Bobo Shanti Tribe)**

**Source Classification: CENTER** - Bobo Ashanti practitioner testimony

**Testimony on Human Rights**:
> "Humanitarian principles take precedence - hence our right to practise our religion - and Rastafari religion include the use of ganja as a sacrament. As far as our livity is concerned, our use of sacrament should be protected under the human rights order."

### Recent Court Cases and Legal Victories

#### **2025 - Ras Jermaine Jackson Case**

**Source Classification: CENTER** - Recent legal victory for sacramental rights

**Case Details**: Police charged sacramental grower Ras Jermaine Jackson and girlfriend Melissa Blake with illegal possession and dealing in ganja following operation at their Retirement, Orange Hill premises in Negril.

**Legal Defense**: Attorney Marcus Goffe argued that his client "is part of the Rastafari sacred, sacramental ecosystem, and he is not to be charged with possession or dealing in ganja."

**Outcome**: The clerk of court agreed and the case was withdrawn. 76 pounds of herbs and processing equipment were returned to Jackson.

**Significance**: Demonstrates current legal recognition of sacramental rights under Jamaica's 2015 Dangerous Drugs Act amendments.

#### **2022 - Bull Bay Elder Case**

**Source Classification: CENTER** - Ongoing legal challenges

**Case**: Rastafarian elder arrested and charged on National Heroes' Day for cultivating ganja at Sugar Loaf Peak Nyabingi Centre, Bob Marley Beach in Bull Bay.

**Community Response**: Marcus Goffe, representing the elder and the broader Rastafari community, stated: "We, the [Rastafari] community, are prepared to take it further, because if the Government will not intervene to protect our rights, maybe the courts will do so, because we have been calling on the commissioner of police for years to intervene to protect us from the abuse and we don't see any kind of protection or intervention in that regard."

### The Three Mansions and Sacramental Practice

#### **Nyabinghi Order**

**Source Classification: CENTER** - Traditional Rastafari mansion

**Historical Background**: The Nyahbinghi Order is the oldest of all Rastafari mansions, named after Queen Niyabinghi, a 19th-century Ugandan ruler who fought against the British Empire.

**Sacramental Practice**: Nyabinghi practitioners hold sacred gatherings known as "Groundations," where they honor Jah through communal songs, drumming, and the smoking of cannabis as a sacrament.

**Sacred Context**: Ganja is used in spiritual ceremonies, meditation, and reasoning sessions, often smoked in a communal chalice or pipe to foster unity and aid meditation.

#### **Bobo Ashanti (Ethiopia Africa Black International Congress)**

**Source Classification: CENTER** - Strict adherence mansion

**Founded**: 1958 by Emmanuel Charles Edwards during the "groundation" period of protests calling for repatriation.

**Distinctive Practice**: Bobo Ashanti are the strictest of all Rastafari mansions. They consider themselves the "Priesthood Order" of Rastafari.

**Sacramental Approach**: "Bobo Ashanti do smoke marijuana like the other mansions of Rastafari, but do not do so in public because it is a sacred practice to be done at times of worship. The Bobo Ashanti do consume marijuana, however prefer to use it more intentionally rather than recreationally. They call it 'holy herb' and it is used as a spiritual sacrament rather than an indulgence."

**Sacred Boundaries**: "It is normally smoked during worship or meditation" - emphasizing the distinction between sacred and recreational use.

#### **Twelve Tribes of Israel**

**Source Classification: CENTER** - Liberal Rastafari mansion

**Founded**: 1968 by Dr. Vernon "Prophet Gad" Carrington

**Character**: "The most liberal of all the other Rastafarian orders" allowing members more freedom in their worship practices.

**Sacramental Use**: Like other mansions, "Ganja is considered a holy sacrament" with emphasis on "Reasoning Sessions: Gatherings where Rastas debate philosophy, scripture, and social issues while passing the chalice of ganja."

**Inclusivity**: More open to other races, attracting musicians and entertainers who find the less strict rites more accessible.

### Biblical and Theological Foundations

#### **VOICES TO CENTER** - Rastafari Theological Perspectives

**Biblical Justification**: Rastafari practitioners consistently cite Biblical verses such as Psalm 104:14: "He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man..." as justification for their spiritual use of ganja.

**Theological Understanding**: "Far from recreational, ganja is considered a sacrament, a healing herb given by Jah. It is used in spiritual ceremonies, meditation, and reasoning sessions."

**Spiritual Function**: "Rastas believe ganja opens the mind, aids meditation, and fosters unity" and provides a direct connection to the divine.

### Historic Legal Case - Dennis Forsythe (1997)

#### **REFERENCE ONLY** - Colonial legal restrictions requiring critique

**Case**: Dr. Dennis Forsythe, described as "a sociologist, holist, author, Rastafarian and attorney-at-law," petitioned the Supreme Court for declaration that his constitutional rights to freedom of conscience and religion had been infringed by the Dangerous Drugs Act 1924.

**Outcome**: Three-member bench unanimously rejected the submissions, reasoning was based on "restrictions on Constitutional rights in the interest of public health, and the protection afforded to the Dangerous Drugs Act by a 'savings' clause which ring-fenced laws in existence when the country gained political independence in 1962 against constitutional challenge."

**Significance**: Demonstrates how colonial-era laws continued to restrict indigenous religious practices post-independence.

## 2. Women's Voices in Rastafari - Critical Documentation Gaps

### **CRITICAL GAPS IN AVAILABLE SOURCES**

Research reveals significant underrepresentation of Rastafari women's voices on sacramental ganja use, highlighting potential gender biases in available documentation and the need for amplifying women practitioners' perspectives.

### Limited Available Women's Perspectives

#### **Donisha Prendergast (Bob Marley's Granddaughter)**

**Source Classification: CENTER** - Contemporary Rastafari woman's voice

**Testimony on Ganja as Medicine**:
> "Rastas don't 'do drugs' because ganja is not a drug. Ganja is a plant. The spiritual power of marijuana comes from the circumstances in which it's used: a combination of the person's intention when they smoke marijuana, as well as the physical space where it's used."

**Cultural Context**: Prendergast emphasizes the importance of intention and sacred context in distinguishing sacramental from recreational use.

### Women's Religious Practices and Spaces

#### **CRITICAL USE** - Academic observations requiring community validation

**Women's Groundings**: "Most groundings contain only men, although some Rasta women have established their own all-female grounding circles."

**Cultural Position**: "There is a more popular culture where women are seen as queens and empresses. There is an overarching doctrine and ideology that holds and celebrates women as the figure of the Black Madonna, the source of all creation, restoring a sense of regal dignity in black women."

**SACRED KNOWLEDGE BOUNDARIES**: Much of women's specific spiritual practices and perspectives on sacramental ganja use may remain within community circles and require direct community consultation for appropriate documentation.

## 3. Hindu/Shaivite Traditions and Cannabis

### Traditional Sadhus and Practitioners

#### **VOICES TO CENTER** - Direct Shaivite Practitioner Testimony

**Traditional Sadhu Perspective**:
> "Normal people need food, we need [ganja]" - statement from attendee at Maha Shivaratri festival, reflecting the essential spiritual role of cannabis for Shaivite practitioners.

**Spiritual Practice**: "Sadhus, or holy mendicants devoted to the ascetic life and to following Lord Shiva, consume large quantities of cannabis flowers and hashish from small clay pipes (called chillums) during rituals of worship, meditation, and yoga."

**Religious Function**: "The act of smoking weed is seen as a means of spiritual enlightenment, an action handed down by the gods."

### Ancient Vedic Traditions

#### **VOICES TO CENTER** - Indigenous Hindu textual authority

**Atharva Veda (2000-1400 BCE)**: Cannabis mentioned as one of "five sacred plants... which release us from anxiety" with "a guardian angel resides in its leaves."

**Vedic Terminology**: "The Vedas also refer to it as a 'source of happiness,' 'joy-giver' and 'liberator'."

**Spiritual Significance**: "In Hinduism, wise drinking of bhang (which contains cannabis), according to religious rites, is believed to cleanse sins, unite one with Shiva and avoid the miseries of hell in the future life."

### Festival Contexts and Community Practice

#### **Maha Shivaratri - Annual Sacred Observance**

**Source Classification: CENTER** - Traditional Hindu festival practice

**Legal Recognition**: "On significant dates throughout the year, such as Maha Shivratri, India and neighboring countries such as Nepal lift the legal restrictions on cannabis consumption, providing tons of cannabis to people and Sadhus for free."

**Community Participation**: "While not everyone involved smokes cannabis, thousands of people do. Most of the smokers use the same type of chillums that Shiva would have used thousands of years ago."

**Sacred Context**: "It is traditionally consumed during festivals like Shivaratri (one of the major festival of Hindus), where devotees of Lord Shiva use cannabis as an offering and as part of their spiritual practice."

#### **Holi Festival Context**

**Traditional Practice**: "Bhang is traditionally distributed during the spring festival of Maha Shivaratri and Holi" as part of religious observance.

**Cultural Integration**: "Bhang is heavily consumed in Mathura, an ancient town of religious importance to Hindus. Here, the practice is believed to have been introduced by the followers of Shiva."

### Ayurvedic Medical Traditions

#### **VOICES TO CENTER** - Traditional Hindu Medical Authority

**Ancient Medical Texts**:

**Sushruta Samhita**: "Recommends cannabis plant extract for treating respiratory ailments and diarrhoea."

**Therapeutic Applications**: "Traditional therapeutic uses include: Anxiety-reducing properties, pain relief for chronic and inflammatory conditions, stimulating digestion, acting as analgesics, nervous system stimulants, having sedative, spasmolytic, diuretic, and aphrodisiac actions."

**Purification Practices**: "Ayurveda classifies Cannabis as a 'sub-toxic herb' which means it must be purified before being consumed. In order to purify the plant, the leaves are tied together in cloth, then boiled in milk for three hours before being dried and fried in ghee."

**Contemporary Practice**: "Bhang can be used in the form of medicine if the patient has a prescription from an Ayurvedic practitioner. There are around 209 formulations mentioned in Ayurveda using Cannabis as single ingredient."

### Theological and Spiritual Significance

#### **Lord Shiva and Cannabis Connection**

**Source Classification: CENTER** - Traditional Hindu theological understanding

**Mythological Background**: "The Hindu god of transformation, Shiva, is believed to have used bhang to focus inward and harness his divine powers, and Shiva became known as the Lord of Bhang."

**Spiritual Meaning**: "In the Shaivite tradition, bhang is used as an offering to Shiva, signifying the surrender of all of life's intoxications to the divine."

**Sacred Practice**: "Offering bhang and other intoxicating narcotics to Lord Shiva has a deep spiritual meaning, similar to sacrificing (surrendering) all impurities and negativities from one's life at the Lord's feet."

### Regional Variations and Community Practices

#### **North India Traditional Use**

**Source Classification: CENTER** - Regional practitioner traditions

**Traditional Communities**: "Some martial artists in northern India, mainly wrestlers, take bhang with a paste made of almonds, pistachios, black pepper, saffron, rose petals etc., mixed with fresh cow's milk - to ensure long term concentration during exhausting all-day practice."

**Sacred Geography**: Traditional use concentrated in areas of Shaivite devotion, particularly in Himalayan regions and places associated with Lord Shiva.

#### **Nepal and Himalayan Traditions**

**Source Classification: CENTER** - Traditional mountain communities

**Traditional Use**: "Cannabis has been used for generations in Nepal through ethno-medicine practices, treating conditions such as diarrhea, constipation, and snake bites in remote communities."

**Cultural Integration**: "Among Shaivite ascetics, charas and bhang are used in devotional ritual" throughout the Himalayan region.

#### **Bengal and Eastern India**

**CRITICAL USE** - Requiring decolonial context

**Colonial Impact**: "The colonial period introduced state-managed ganja production, particularly in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa" - representing colonial appropriation and commodification of traditional practices.

## 4. Pre-Colonial Traditional Knowledge vs. Colonial Narratives

### Pre-Colonial Cannabis Use in India

#### **VOICES TO CENTER** - Indigenous Traditional Knowledge

**Ancient Origins**: "Cannabis use in India dates back to at least 2000 BCE, with the earliest references found in the sacred texts known as the Vedas, which date back to around 1500 to 500 BCE."

**Religious Integration**: "The earliest mention of Bhanga (cannabis preparation) is from the Atharva Veda (2000 BC to 1400 BC), where it is described as a sacred grass alongside alternate connotations of it as Indracana (Food of Gods), Vijaya (Victory), and Amrita (gift)."

**Medical Tradition**: "In the Sushruta Samhita (600 AD), derivatives of cannabis were advocated as valuable medicines useful in treating certain phlegmatic ailments."

**Cultural Significance**: "Before British rule, cannabis assumed great significance in the socio-economic, cultural, and religious spheres."

### Colonial Suppression and Resistance

#### **REJECT** - Colonial Prohibition Narratives

**British Intervention Strategy**: "Until the 1870s, the colonial attitude towards cannabis had mostly been ambivalent. However, William Sproston Caine, a Baptist and fierce advocate of abstinence and temperance raised a concern at the House of Commons about cannabis due to his perception shaped by missionaries, that disapproved of indigenous religious practices in India."

**Indigenous Resistance**: "Herbs such as cannabis provided native physicians with a coherent power to resist colonial medical intervention, demonstrating its importance in indigenous therapeutic practices."

**Colonial Impact on Medicine**: "British policies on cannabis caused its ban leading to natives' reliance on colonial cannabis products, and as a result, the native medical practitioners resisted for reviving cannabis in the indigenous therapeutics."

### The 1894 Indian Hemp Drugs Commission

#### **CRITICAL USE** - Colonial study requiring indigenous context

**Colonial Assessment**: Despite prohibition attempts, the 1894 British Indian government study of cannabis concluded:

> "The moderate use of these drugs is the rule, and that the excessive use is comparatively exceptional. The moderate use practically produces no ill effects. In all but the most exceptional cases, the injury from habitual moderate use is not appreciable."

**Finding on Social Impact**: "The injury done by the excessive use is, however, confined almost exclusively to the consumer himself; the effect on society is rarely appreciable."

**Indigenous Knowledge Validation**: This colonial study inadvertently validated traditional indigenous understanding of cannabis as beneficial when used appropriately.

### Pre-Colonial African Cannabis Traditions

#### **VOICES TO CENTER** - African Innovation and Traditional Knowledge

**African Innovation**: "In sub-Saharan Africa, cannabis was taken into ethnobotanies that included pipe smoking, a practice invented in Africa; in Asia, it had been consumed orally."

**Technological Development**: "Prehistoric people in eastern Africa invented smoking pipes. After the plant arrived from south Asia, eastern Africans discovered that smoking was a more efficient way to consume cannabis compared with edible forms of the drug."

**Cultural Spread**: "The African innovation of smoking cannabis initiated the now-global practice."

### African Ceremonial and Social Traditions

#### **VOICES TO CENTER** - Traditional African Cannabis Culture

**Religious Ceremonies**: "For their religious ceremonies, which occurred nightly, the men stripped naked and shaved their heads. Then they sat in a large circle and smoked cannabis from large pipes."

**Community Activities**: "In addition to these nightly get-togethers, cannabis was smoked on all important holidays and at the conclusion of all alliances."

**Social Games**: "Smoking dagga was a recreational activity for many tribes, which in turn spawned its own recreational games. One such game played by the Zulus and the Thonga was a spitting contest."

**Water Pipe Innovation**: "Africans invented water pipes, historically associated primarily with cannabis, and dry pipes, associated primarily with tobacco. Notably, all water pipes – hookahs, bongs, shishas and so on – trace ultimately to African precedents."

### Colonial Suppression of African Traditions

#### **REJECT** - Colonial Prohibition and Cultural Destruction

**Colonial Suppression**: "Cannabis was outlawed across most of the continent by 1920. Africans resisted its prohibition, and cannabis production remains economically significant despite its continued illegality."

**Knowledge Erasure**: "Primary sources on these plants are predominantly from European observers, which limits historical knowledge because Europeans strongly favored tobacco and were mostly ignorant or disdainful of African cannabis uses."

**Cultural Continuity Despite Suppression**: "There is strong evidence that psychoactive cannabis crossed the Atlantic with Africans. Oral histories from Brazil, Jamaica, Liberia and Sierra Leone tell that enslaved central Africans carried cannabis."

### African Diaspora and Global Influence

#### **VOICES TO CENTER** - African Knowledge Preservation

**Language Preservation**: "The people who transported seeds shaped our modern language. Around the Atlantic, many terms for cannabis trace to central Africa, including the global word marijuana, derived from Kimbundu mariamba."

**Cultural Transmission**: "In 1840s Gabon, a French-American traveller observed a man 'carefully preserving (seeds), intending to plant them in the country to which he should be sold.'"

**Resistance Through Preservation**: African communities maintained cannabis knowledge and practices despite systematic colonial suppression, contributing to global cannabis culture through the diaspora.

## 5. Contemporary Legal and Religious Freedom Issues

### Jamaican Legal Framework and Ongoing Struggles

#### **Current Legal Status**

**Source Classification: CENTER** - Legal protections achieved through Rastafari advocacy

**2015 Amendments**: "Sacramental use of cannabis in celebration of the Rastafari faith became legal in Jamaica on April 15, 2015. Under the Dangerous Drugs Act, which came into effect on April 15, 2015, provisions were implemented for the possession and smoking of ganja; the use of ganja by those of the Rastafarian faith; and the use of ganja for medical, therapeutic, and scientific purposes."

#### **Ongoing Implementation Challenges**

**Licensing Issues**: "Numerous Rastafarians, including the elder who was arrested, had applied for licences to allow them to cultivate ganja for sacramental use but said the Ministry of Justice had not put a proper framework in place to facilitate the issuance of those licences."

**Police Education Needs**: Practitioners continue to call for police education on religious rights and proper implementation of the 2015 amendments.

### International Legal Pressures

#### **REJECT** - International Prohibition Pressures

**UN Opposition**: "In the 2017 Annual Report of the United Nations International Narcotics Control Board, the organisation expressed its disapproval of the sacramental clause included in Jamaica's medical ganja laws."

**International Pressure**: "'The board reminds the Government of Jamaica ... that ... only the medical and scientific use of cannabis is authorised and that use for any other purposes, including religious, is not permitted,' read the report."

**Significance**: International drug control bodies continue to oppose indigenous and traditional religious uses despite national legal protections.

### Post-Colonial Cannabis Criminalization in India

#### **CRITICAL USE** - Colonial Legacy Analysis

**Contemporary Prohibition**: "Buckling under the pressure from the US and other Western countries, the Rajiv Gandhi government finally enacted the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act in 1985, effectively criminalizing the use of the fruit and flower of cannabis, excluding the leaves that are used to make Bhaang."

**Colonial Continuity**: "The criminalization of cannabis in India is yet another colonial symptom of white supremacy that we are having a hard time letting go of, despite India's 4000-year relationship with cannabis."

**Current Status**: "In India, cultivation, manufacture, sale, and possession of different forms of cannabis (charas/resin, hasis/liquid form, and ganja/flowering tops) is prohibited under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, except for leaves or seeds (Bhang)."

#### **Religious Freedom Tensions**

**Festival Permissions**: Despite overall prohibition, "On significant dates throughout the year, such as Maha Shivratri, India and neighboring countries such as Nepal lift the legal restrictions on cannabis consumption" demonstrating recognition of religious significance.

**Traditional Medicine Protection**: "Medicinal use of cannabis in India is primarily confined to traditional systems of medicine such as Ayurveda and Homeopathy" - preserving some traditional uses.

### Nepal's Legal Evolution

#### **Contemporary Developments**

**Source Classification: CENTER** - Recent indigenous rights progress

**Historical Prohibition**: "Cannabis has been illegal in Nepal since 1976, but the country has a long history of use for Ayurvedic medicine, as an intoxicant, and as a holy offering for Hindu god Shiva."

**Recent Progress**: "In May 2024, Finance Minister Barsaman Pun announced that medicinal marijuana would be legalized in Nepal."

**Traditional Continuity**: Despite legal restrictions, "More than 97% of respondents in western Nepal directly stated they plant Cannabis, and all households consumed cannabis seeds as highly nutritious food crops, both at home and at community gatherings."

## 6. Critical Issues to Document

### Sacramental vs. Recreational Use Distinctions

#### **VOICES TO CENTER** - Practitioner Definitions

**Rastafari Perspective**:

**Donisha Prendergast**: "The spiritual power of marijuana comes from the circumstances in which it's used: a combination of the person's intention when they smoke marijuana, as well as the physical space where it's used."

**Community Understanding**: "Far from recreational, ganja is considered a sacrament, a healing herb given by Jah. It is used in spiritual ceremonies, meditation, and reasoning sessions."

**Sacred Context**: Practitioners emphasize the importance of proper ceremonial context, community guidance, and spiritual intention in distinguishing sacramental from recreational use.

**Hindu/Shaivite Perspective**:

**Traditional Practice**: "In Hinduism, wise drinking of bhang (which contains cannabis), according to religious rites, is believed to cleanse sins, unite one with Shiva."

**Sacred Timing**: Use is connected to specific festivals, ceremonial contexts, and under guidance of traditional practitioners and religious authorities.

**Purification Requirements**: Traditional Ayurvedic practice requires proper preparation and purification of cannabis before sacramental use.

### Internal Community Debates

#### **CRITICAL GAPS** - Limited documentation of internal perspectives

**Rastafari Mansion Differences**: While all three mansions use ganja as sacrament, they differ in practices:

- **Bobo Ashanti**: Most restrictive, emphasizing private worship contexts
- **Twelve Tribes**: Most liberal, allowing more individual interpretation
- **Nyabinghi**: Traditional communal groundation practices

**Hindu Regional Variations**: Different communities and regions maintain varying traditions around cannabis use, from strict ceremonial contexts to broader therapeutic applications.

**Sacred Knowledge Boundaries**: Internal debates about how much traditional knowledge should be shared publicly, especially concerning specific ceremonial practices and preparation methods.

### Impact of Criminalization on Religious Communities

#### **VOICES TO CENTER** - Community Impact Testimony

**Rastafari Experience**:

**Historical Persecution**: "Members of the Rastafari religion and political movement have for decades been persecuted and imprisoned for their ritualistic use of marijuana."

**Continued Harassment**: Despite 2015 legal changes, "adherents, many of them Black, have endured both racial and religious profiling due to their ritualistic use of cannabis."

**Ras Iyah V's Testimony**: "Based on the United Nations Charter, Constitutional Fundamental Human Rights, and the Jamaican Constitution, our rights as Rastafari were continuously being violated for having herbs in our possession."

**Hindu/Indian Experience**:

**Traditional Knowledge Suppression**: "The shift and degeneration of indigenous medicinal cannabis was due to the decline of indigenous therapeutic practices, primarily due to the lack of initiatives undertaken by the British Government."

**Cultural Disconnection**: Criminalization has separated many practitioners from traditional preparation methods and community guidance systems.

### Commercialization and Commodification Concerns

#### **VOICES TO CENTER** - Community Concerns about Economic Justice

**Who Profits vs. Who Was Criminalized**: The tension between communities that were criminalized for traditional use and commercial interests now profiting from legalization.

**Cultural Appropriation in Commerce**: Concerns about non-practitioners commercializing sacred plants and practices without community consent or benefit.

**Traditional Knowledge Extraction**: Commercial interests extracting traditional preparation methods and therapeutic knowledge without compensating originating communities.

### Environmental and Agricultural Aspects

#### **Traditional Growing Methods**

**Rastafari Perspectives**:

**Sacred Relationship to Land**: Many practitioners view cannabis cultivation as a sacred practice requiring proper relationship to the earth and natural growing methods.

**Community Gardens**: Traditional approach emphasizes community-based cultivation rather than large-scale commercial operations.

**Hindu/Indian Perspectives**:

**Traditional Agriculture**: "In Nepal's hilly regions, cannabis was historically used as cattle fodder, fiber (hemp), and by some for psychotropic effects" - representing integrated agricultural systems.

**Sacred Geography**: Cultivation in areas considered sacred to Lord Shiva, with specific rituals and offerings connected to growing practices.

**Seed Preservation**: Traditional communities maintain heritage seed varieties passed down through generations.
