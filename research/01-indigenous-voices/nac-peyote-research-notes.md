# Native American Church and Peyote Tradition Research Notes

## Executive Summary

This research focuses on Native American Church (NAC) official positions, Indigenous Peyote Conservation Initiative (IPCI) work, and direct testimonies from practitioners regarding cultural appropriation, conservation, legal battles, and intergenerational transmission. The research prioritizes centering direct NAC and indigenous voices while critically examining external perspectives.

**Key Finding**: NAC leadership consistently opposes non-native use of peyote and has established clear boundaries regarding cultural appropriation, while facing critical conservation and legal challenges that threaten the tradition's survival.

## 1. Native American Church Official Positions

### Cultural Appropriation and Non-Native Use

#### PRIMARY SOURCE: National Council of Native American Churches (2016)

**Source Classification: CENTER** - Direct NAC organizational voice

**Official Position**: In 2016, the National Council of Native American Churches issued a statement condemning illegitimate organizations that adopt the name "Native American Church" to allow them to use peyote and other substances in their ceremonies.

**Key Quotes**:

- Cultural appropriation and misappropriation are identified as "real concerns" by Native American Church leaders
- Church leaders state that "the Native American Church in itself has been appropriated"
- Representatives emphasize that peyote use is not merely experimental but represents a way of life for which Native Americans have been persecuted

**Community Authority**: This represents the highest official organizational voice of the NAC

#### SUPPORTING VOICE: Urban Indigenous Collective (2023)

**Source Classification: CENTER** - Indigenous advocacy organization

**Position**: "My own perspective is that non-Indigenous peoples should leave peyote ceremony to Indigenous peoples" - citing Native American Church advocacy positions

#### TESTIMONY: NAC Leadership Concerns

**Source Classification: CENTER** - Direct practitioner voices

Church leaders express concern that when people appropriate their culture, "they take what they can from books, or from what little they know, and try to mimic a certain culture" and "sometimes they do it in the wrong way, and don't know how to do it"

### Legal Status and Conservation Concerns

**Official NAC Position**: The legal status of peyote is described as "precarious," "exacerbated by diminishing supplies of the cactus in the United States and by the appropriation and exploitation of Native American religious practices by non-Natives seeking legal protection to both use and profit from peyote"

## 2. Indigenous Peyote Conservation Initiative (IPCI)

### Organization and Mission

#### SOURCE: IPCI Official Information

**Source Classification: CENTER** - Indigenous-led conservation organization

**Founded**: 2017 by the National Council of Native American Churches
**Origin**: Created after the Peyote Research Project (PRP) commissioned by the Native American Church of North America
**Mission**: To sustain the spiritual practices of Indigenous peoples for generations to come, promoting health, well-being, and Native cultural revitalization through sovereignty and sustainability of the sacred peyote plant

**Key Action**: In October 2017, the National Council of Native American Churches purchased 605 acres in Hebbronville, Texas, to establish a peyote preserve and a "spiritual homesite"

### IPCI Leadership and Board Members

#### Steven Benally (Diné/Navajo)

**Source Classification: CENTER** - Indigenous practitioner and IPCI board member

- Member of the Dine Nation (Navajo Nation)
- Lifelong member of the Azee Bee Nahagha (Peyote Ceremonial way of life)
- Former President of Azee Bee Nahagha of Dine Nation (9 years)
- Founding member of IPCI Board of Directors
- Elder from Sweetwater, Arizona

**Testimony on Spiritual Significance**:
"Our belief is that these plants, these animals, these birds are just like us. They can hear, they can understand. They have their powers, they have their place, a purpose and a reason — just like us."

"It's a must-have in order to pray," says Steven Benally about peyote.

**Historical Loss**: Benally recalls losing access to the gardens after the "peyotero" system took over, where government-licensed peyoteros harvested the plant and sold them to Native American Church members, breaking the sacred connection with the land.

#### Sandor Iron Rope (Oglala Lakota)

**Source Classification: CENTER** - Indigenous practitioner and NAC leader

- Enrolled member of the Oglala Lakota Oyate from Pine Ridge South Dakota
- President of the Native American Church of South Dakota
- Former chair of Native American Church of North America
- IPCI Board member
- Executive director of Tiognaka Tawowaka Otokahe (The beginning of a sacred home)

**Testimony on Action and Prayer**:
"You can pray all you want, but you're going to have to meet the Creator halfway somewhere. You're going to have to implement that prayer into action."

**Mission**: Teaching future generations the value of getting back to their ancestors' spiritual and healing ways

#### Arlen Lightfoot (NAC Oklahoma)

**Source Classification: CENTER** - Indigenous practitioner and NAC leader

- President of the Native American Church of Oklahoma
- United States Navy Veteran
- IPCI Board member
- National Council of Native American Churches member

#### Dawn Davis (Shoshone-Bannock)

**Source Classification: CENTER** - Indigenous researcher and practitioner

- Newe (Shoshone-Bannock) PhD candidate at University of Idaho
- Self-identifies as both peyote researcher and peyotist
- IPCI and NCNAC member

**Research Focus**: "Davis's research centers on how much land is available for peyote cultivation and habitat"

**Conservation Threats Identified**:
"There are many threats that impact peyote populations – wind turbine development, overharvesting, oil development, exurban development, and issues with poaching"

"Over the last ten years, wind turbine development within peyote gardens has had a huge impact on peyote populations, completely extirpating large populations of cacti from the natural range"

## 3. Legal Battles for Religious Freedom

### Employment Division v. Smith (1990)

#### CASE SUMMARY

**Source Classification: CRITICAL USE** - Legal decision requiring contextualization

**Participants**: Alfred Smith and Galen Black (NAC members) vs. Oregon Employment Division
**Issue**: Fired from drug rehabilitation jobs for sacramental peyote use, denied unemployment benefits

**Supreme Court Ruling**: Prohibiting Native Americans from using peyote in religious rituals does not violate constitutional right to free exercise of religion

**Legal Impact**: Changed religious free exercise law by ruling that generally applicable laws not targeting specific religious practices do not violate the First Amendment

#### CONGRESSIONAL RESPONSE

**Source Classification: CENTER** - Legislative protection for NAC

**Religious Freedom Restoration Act (1993)**: Passed in response to Smith decision
**American Indian Religious Freedom Act Amendments (1994)**: Public Law 103-344 provided legislative protection specifically for NAC religious practices

**Key Protection**: "The use, possession, or transportation of peyote by an Indian for bona fide traditional ceremonial purposes in connection with the practice of a traditional Indian religion is lawful, and shall not be prohibited by the United States or by any State"

#### JUDICIAL DISSENTS

**Justice Harry Blackmun** (joined by Justices Brennan and Marshall): Argued that Smith and Black's interest in using peyote in religious sacraments outweighed Oregon's interest in applying anti-peyote laws

**Current Status**: Oregon has since joined 23 other states and the federal government in declaring sacramental use of peyote in Native American ceremonies legal

## 4. Environmental Crisis: Peyote Conservation

### Conservation Status

#### SCIENTIFIC ASSESSMENT

**Source Classification: CRITICAL USE** - Scientific data requiring indigenous context

**IUCN Red List Status**: Vulnerable (as of 2017)
**Growth Rate**: Flowers and matures over 10 to 30 years
**US Legal Status**: Not recognized as endangered, no state or federal protection

### Primary Threats

#### Overharvesting

**Sources**: Multiple IPCI and scientific sources
**Issue**: Poaching and excessive harvesting of slow-growing cactus
**Impact**: "The Texas peyote gardens presently suffer from severe over-harvesting caused by an increasing demand for more peyote from a shrinking limited supply"

#### Habitat Loss and Development

**Sources**: IPCI research and scientific studies
**Threats**:

- Agriculture and housing developments
- Wind farms ("completely extirpating large populations")
- Border wall construction
- Root plowing ("if you root plow a piece of land, peyote does not come back")

#### Texas Ranch Dynamics

**Issue**: "Habitat shrinkage has driven overharvesting by both legal peyoteros and poachers, who routinely jump fences to steal medicine from private land"
**Rancher Response**: "Ranchers who are frustrated by constant poaching sometimes demand that pickers uproot entire peyote plants rather than slicing off only the buttons—a drastic attempt to stop the trespassing by ridding their lands of medicine"

#### Additional Factors

- Psychedelic tourism
- Criminal drug trade
- Illegal poaching
- Global warming
- Worldwide internet sales
- Rooting by feral pigs

## 5. IPCI Position on Decriminalization

### Official Statement

#### SOURCE: NCNAC and IPCI Joint Statement

**Source Classification: CENTER** - Official indigenous position

**Position**: "The respectful course moving forward is to NOT include the word 'peyote' in any local decriminalization resolutions, initiatives, or efforts, put before governing bodies"

**Reasoning**:

- Concerns about "an increase in poachers"
- "Pure decriminalization would be dangerous for peyote as a species, and problematic in terms of public policy"

**Community Authority**: Signed by Steven Benally, Sandor Iron Rope, Arlen Lightfoot, and other NCNAC/IPCI leadership

## 6. Intergenerational Knowledge Transmission

### Traditional Mechanisms

#### SOURCE: General NAC Information

**Source Classification: CRITICAL USE** - Academic description requiring indigenous context

**Ceremonial Structure**: Two main umbrella fireplaces (ceremonial peyote altars passed down generationally from family):

- Half-Moon fireplace
- Cross-Fire fireplace

**Transmission Method**: Family-based ceremonial altar inheritance system

### Contemporary Challenges

#### Historical Disruption

**Issues**:

- Forced relocation to reservations
- Removal of children to boarding schools
- Disruption of ceremonial knowledge transmission

#### Contemporary Revitalization

**Patterns**:

- Renewed interest among younger generations
- Desire to reconnect with cultural roots
- Combination of traditional and modern methods
- Use of technology for connecting practitioners

### IPCI Youth Education

#### Conservation Education Program

**Source Classification: CENTER** - Indigenous-led program

**Action**: "In early 2019, IPCI held its first peyote harvest on the 605, educating children alongside their families on how to harvest in an ecologically and spiritually respectful way"

**Facility Development**: "A culturally appropriate nursery and distribution center being built by hand in adobe by community members, as well as a welcome center, youth housing, and a bathhouse"

## 7. Sacred Knowledge Boundaries

- Commercial peyote vendors or tour operators
- Academic interpretations that speak FOR indigenous communities
- Tourism promotion materials
- Neurochemical reductionist explanations without cultural context

#### Red Flags to Avoid

- Claims to "discover" known practices
- Purely scientific explanations without cultural context
- Non-indigenous "experts" on NAC traditions
- Materials that could facilitate appropriation
- Sensationalized or romanticized portrayals

## 9. Key Themes for Video Content

### Primary Narrative Threads

1. **NAC Self-Determination**: How the church defines its own boundaries and membership
2. **Conservation Crisis**: Environmental and cultural threats to peyote and traditions
3. **Legal Struggles**: Ongoing battles for religious freedom and protection
4. **Cultural Boundaries**: Clear indigenous perspectives on appropriation vs. legitimate practice
5. **Intergenerational Continuity**: Efforts to preserve traditions for future generations

### Critical Messages to Convey

1. **Respect Indigenous Sovereignty**: NAC has right to define its own practices and membership
2. **Conservation Urgency**: Peyote faces real environmental threats requiring immediate action
3. **Legal Vulnerability**: Religious protections remain fragile and require ongoing defense
4. **Cultural Appropriation Harm**: Non-native use threatens both conservation and cultural integrity
5. **Community Solutions**: Indigenous-led initiatives offer the most effective approaches

## 10. Research Gaps and Limitations

### Missing Voices

- More youth perspectives on maintaining traditions
