- Identify who should NOT speak for traditions
- Note internal community debates

### Step 2: Assess Available Materials

- What's already public vs. private
- Quality of existing documentation
- Gaps in current narratives
- Misrepresentations to correct

### Step 3: Ethical Review

- Can we access this respectfully?
- Should this knowledge be shared widely?
- Who benefits from this research?
- What harm could result?

### Step 4: Documentation Method

- How to preserve community voice
- Attribution and credit protocols
- Compensation considerations
- Ongoing consent processes

## Initial Research Actions

### Week 1 Priorities

1. **Establish Contacts**

## Red Lines: What We Won't Do

- Speak for communities we don't belong to
- Prioritize academic over community voices
- Share information that could cause harm
- Ignore community objections to our work
- Treat sacred practices as entertainment
- Contribute to cultural appropriation
