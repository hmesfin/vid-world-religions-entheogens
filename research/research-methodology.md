# Research Methodology: World Religions and Entheogens

## Guiding Principles (from CLAUDE.md)

Our research methodology explicitly rejects Western academic hegemony and centers indigenous and community voices. We approach this work with epistemological humility, acknowledging what we cannot know as outsiders to many traditions.

## Research Phases and Priority System

### Phase 1: Community and Indigenous Voices (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

#### Timeline: Weeks 1-3

#### Sources to Seek

- **Direct testimonies and interviews**
  - Medicine people and traditional practitioners (with consent protocols)
  - Community elders discussing historical practices
  - Contemporary practitioners navigating tradition and modernity
  - Youth perspectives on traditional knowledge preservation

- **Community-produced materials**
  - Indigenous media productions and documentaries
  - Community newsletters and self-published accounts
  - Social media accounts of practitioners (with ethical considerations)
  - Oral history projects and digital archives

- **Indigenous scholarship**
  - Works by indigenous academics writing about their own traditions
  - Community-based participatory research projects
  - Indigenous universities and knowledge centers

#### Ethical Protocols

- Never extract knowledge without giving back to communities
- Respect boundaries around sacred or secret knowledge
- Seek explicit permission for any use of community voices
- Consider compensation or reciprocity for knowledge sharing
- Be prepared to exclude material if communities object

### Phase 2: Critical and Decolonial Scholarship

#### Timeline: Weeks 2-4 (overlapping with Phase 1)

#### Priority Authors and Perspectives

- **Decolonial theorists on religion and knowledge**
  - Linda Tuhiwai Smith on indigenous research methodologies
  - Walter Mignolo on epistemic disobedience
  - Boaventura de Sousa Santos on epistemologies of the South
  - Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui on ch'ixi methodology

- **Critical anthropologists**
  - Those examining their discipline's colonial history
  - Scholars practicing "anthropology of anthropology"
  - Researchers using participatory action research methods

- **Non-Western religious scholars**
  - Islamic scholars on consciousness and spirituality
  - Buddhist academics from Asian institutions
  - Hindu scholars writing in Sanskrit/vernacular traditions
  - African traditional religion experts from African universities

### Phase 3: Western Academic Sources (CRITICAL EVALUATION)

#### Timeline: Weeks 3-4

#### Evaluation Framework for Each Source

1. **Colonial Context Check**
   - When was this written and under what political conditions?
   - What power dynamics existed between researcher and researched?
   - How did the researcher gain access to this knowledge?

2. **Contradiction Analysis**
   - Does this contradict community understanding?
   - Are indigenous voices included or cited?
   - What assumptions underlie the interpretations?

3. **Utility Assessment**
   - Does this add value beyond what communities say themselves?
   - Can we use this while acknowledging its limitations?
   - Should this be excluded entirely as inappropriate?

## Specific Research Priorities

### Tradition-Specific Focus Areas

#### Amazonian Traditions

- Prioritize indigenous voices from specific peoples (Shipibo, Cofán, etc.)
- Seek out female practitioners often excluded from academic accounts
- Document contemporary struggles around cultural preservation
- Avoid "ayahuasca tourism" perspectives

#### Vedic/Hindu Traditions

- Center Sanskrit scholars and traditional pandits
- Include Dalit and Adivasi perspectives often excluded
- Examine colonial period distortions of soma theories
- Contemporary practitioners vs. Western interpretations

#### Abrahamic Mysteries

- Mystical traditions within Islam, Christianity, Judaism
- Suppressed histories and alternative interpretations
- Contemporary progressive religious scholars
- Power dynamics in interpretation control

#### African Traditions

- Bwiti and other plant medicine traditions
- Resistance to colonial religious impositions
- Contemporary practice in diaspora communities
- Reclaiming traditions post-colonization

### Cross-Cutting Themes

#### Women and Gender

- Female practitioners and knowledge keepers
- Gender dynamics in traditional practices
- Feminist critiques of male-dominated narratives
- Non-binary and indigenous gender concepts

#### Youth and Tradition

- How young people engage with traditional practices
- Technology and traditional knowledge transmission
- Cultural preservation vs. evolution debates
- Youth-led indigenous movements

#### Legal and Political

- Indigenous sovereignty over traditional practices
- Religious freedom vs. drug war policies
- UN declarations on indigenous rights
- Contemporary court cases and precedents

## Research Ethics and Accountability

### Continuous Reflection Questions

1. Are we extracting knowledge or building relationships?
2. How will communities benefit from this research?
3. What are we choosing not to research and why?
4. Who might be harmed by this information being public?
5. Are we perpetuating any form of epistemic violence?

### Community Review Process

- Identify key community reviewers for each tradition
- Build in time for community feedback
- Be prepared to remove or revise based on input
- Document changes made based on community guidance

### Transparency Practices

- Document our research decisions and rationales
- Note what we couldn't access and why
- Acknowledge our limitations repeatedly
- Make our biases and positions explicit

## Week-by-Week Research Plan

### Week 1: Foundation and Protocols

- Establish consent and permission protocols
- Identify and reach out to community contacts
- Set up research organization system
- Begin indigenous voices research

### Week 2: Deep Dive into Community Perspectives  

- Continue gathering indigenous testimonies
- Start critical scholarship review
- Document contradictions with Western academic accounts
- Begin visual materials assessment

### Week 3: Critical Analysis and Synthesis

- Evaluate Western academic sources through critical lens
- Identify patterns across traditions
- Note gaps and silences in available materials
- Continue community outreach

### Week 4: Verification and Gaps

- Fact-check contested claims
- Seek community verification where possible
- Identify what we still don't know
- Prepare research synthesis document

## Output Documents

By the end of research phase, we will have:

1. **Community Voices Compilation** - Centered perspectives from practitioners
2. **Critical Analysis Document** - Decolonial examination of academic sources  
3. **Source Evaluation Matrix** - All sources rated by our criteria
4. **Knowledge Gaps Report** - What we couldn't learn and why
5. **Visual Resources Catalog** - Ethically sourced imagery and media
6. **Fact-Check Database** - Verified and contested claims

This methodology ensures we stay true to our commitment to center indigenous voices, challenge Western academic hegemony, and approach this sensitive topic with appropriate humility and accountability.
