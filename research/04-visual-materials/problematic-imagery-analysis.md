# Problematic Historical Imagery: Critical Analysis and Usage Guidelines

## Purpose of This Document

This document identifies problematic historical imagery that may be used ONLY as evidence of colonial extraction and harm. These materials are never to be presented as neutral documentation or authoritative sources, but exclusively as visual proof of ongoing colonialism.

## Category 1: Direct Extraction Documentation

#### "Seeking the Magic Mushroom"

**What it shows:**

- Sparked tourist invasion of Huautla
- Commodified sacred knowledge

**How it can be used:**

- As THE primary example of media extraction

## Visual Techniques for Critical Use

### Split Screen Contrasts

- Indigenous reality | Western representation
- Community practice | Individual extraction
- Sacred context | Commercial product
- Traditional healer | Medical doctor

### Overlay Techniques

- Price tags on sacred imagery
- Patent numbers on traditional knowledge
- Tourist statistics on community footage
- Profit figures on poverty documentation

### Redaction Methods

- Black bars over sacred elements
- Blur ceremonial details
- Pixelate faces without permission
- Cover inappropriate imagery with text

### Duration Limits

- Colonial imagery: 2-5 seconds maximum
- Extraction evidence: 5-10 seconds
- Never linger on problematic content
- Quick cuts to maintain critical distance

## What Must NEVER Be Shown

### Absolute Prohibitions

- Death or dying in ceremonial contexts
- Secret ritual procedures
- Sacred objects without permission
- Ceremony interiors without consent
- Children in vulnerable situations
- Visions or spiritual experiences
- Preparation methods that could enable appropriation

### Additional Restrictions

- No psychedelic visual effects on indigenous content
- No mystical filters or color grading
- No slow motion on ceremony footage
- No zoom on sacred objects
- No enhancement of ceremonial details

## Alternative Visual Strategies

### When Historical Documentation Is Needed

- Use illustration or animation instead
- Show book covers rather than content
- Document impact rather than practice
- Focus on consequences not ceremonies

### Representing Absence

- Empty museum cases after repatriation
- Blank screens with audio testimony
- Text explaining what cannot be shown
- Indigenous artwork representing concepts

### Contemporary Corrections

- Indigenous photographers reclaiming narrative
- Community-controlled documentation
- Sovereignty assertions and protests
- Cultural revitalization without exposure

## Legal Considerations

### Fair Use Application

These materials may be used under fair use for:

- Criticism of colonial practices
- Educational commentary on extraction
- Transformative analysis of power
- Documentary evidence of harm

### Required Elements

- Clear critical framework
- Minimal necessary use
- Transformative purpose
- No market harm to indigenous communities

### Rights Management

- No rights payments to colonial institutions
- Payments to indigenous communities when possible
- Attribution that critiques rather than validates
- Clear statement of critical purpose

## Conclusion

Every use of problematic historical imagery must:

1. Serve the narrative of indigenous sovereignty
2. Expose rather than perpetuate extraction
3. Include critical context and consequence
4. Be minimal and purposeful
5. Never romanticize or neutralize colonial violence

These images are weapons of colonialism that we turn back on themselves, exposing the machinery of extraction while centering indigenous resistance and sovereignty.

*This analysis ensures problematic imagery is used only as evidence of colonial harm, never as neutral documentation or aesthetic material.*
