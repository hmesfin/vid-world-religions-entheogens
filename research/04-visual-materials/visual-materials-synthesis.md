# Visual Materials Synthesis: Complete Framework for Ethical Representation

## Executive Summary

Visual representation in documenting world religions and entheogens requires the same decolonial rigor applied to our research. Every image either perpetuates colonial extraction or supports indigenous sovereignty—there is no neutral visual language. This synthesis provides a complete framework for ethical visual choices that center indigenous creation, expose colonial harm, and respect sacred boundaries absolutely.

## Visual Hierarchy (Aligned with Voice Prioritization)

### 1. PRIMARY: Indigenous-Created Materials

**Always Center:**

- MAHKU Movement paintings and exhibitions
- Indigenous filmmakers' documentaries
- Community-produced visual activism
- Contemporary indigenous artists' work
- Traditional art (with explicit permission and context)

**Key Resources Identified:**

- **MAHKU**: 120+ paintings from "Mirações" exhibition
- **Shipibo artists**: Olinda Silvano, Silvia Ricopa (with compensation)
- **Indigenous photographers**: Jeff Thomas, Robert Kautuk
- **Resistance documentation**: Standing Rock, #NoDAPL footage

### 2. SECONDARY: Critical Documentation

**Use with Heavy Context:**

- Museum repatriation movements
- Legal struggle documentation
- Anti-appropriation protests
- Community sovereignty assertions
- Contemporary indigenous conferences

**Framing Required:**

- Always position as resistance to colonialism
- Include indigenous voices explaining significance
- Show community agency, not victimization
- Brief exposure with clear critical framework

### 3. TERTIARY: Evidence of Extraction

**Only as Proof of Harm:**

- Wasson's Life Magazine (3-5 seconds max)
- Harvard specimen collections
- Patent documentation
- Retreat center marketing
- Clinical trial imagery

**Mandatory Context:**

- Must show consequences of extraction
- Include indigenous testimony on impact
- Use split screens to contrast with reality
- Never longer than 10 seconds total

### 4. PROHIBITED: Never Use

**Absolute Restrictions:**

- Sacred ceremonies without explicit permission
- Death/dying in ceremonial contexts
- Secret ritual procedures or objects
- Ceremony interiors without consent
- Vision experiences or spiritual revelations
- Preparation methods enabling appropriation
- AI-generated "indigenous" imagery
- Stock photos of ceremonies or "shamans"

## Visual Sovereignty Protocols

### Permission and Compensation

**Requirements:**

- Written permission from individuals AND communities
- Fair compensation to creators and communities
- Revenue sharing for ongoing use
- Cultural context provided by indigenous authors
- Right to review and veto final usage

### Attribution Standards

- Full names with indigenous naming preferences
- Tribal/community affiliations
- Role/authority within community
- Direct contact information when appropriate
- Copyright remains with creators

## Critical Visual Techniques

### Exposing Extraction Patterns

**Split Screen Contrasts:**

```markdown
Left: Indigenous Reality | Right: Western Representation
Left: Community Practice | Right: Individual Extraction  
Left: Sacred Context | Right: Commercial Product
Left: Traditional Healer | Right: Medical Doctor
```

**Overlay Methods:**

- Price tags on retreat center imagery ($5,000 retreat vs. $50 local wage)
- Patent numbers on traditional knowledge
- Tourist statistics on community footage
- Corporate profits vs. community poverty

**Redaction Techniques:**

- Black bars over sacred elements
- Blur ceremonial details
- Text cards explaining what cannot be shown
- Respectful absence as powerful statement

### Duration Limits for Problematic Content

- Colonial imagery: 2-5 seconds maximum
- Extraction evidence: 5-10 seconds total
- Commercial materials: 2-3 seconds
- Never linger or aestheticize

## Visual Narrative Structure

### Opening Sequence (First 3 minutes)

**Establish Visual Sovereignty:**

1. Open with MAHKU or indigenous art (full screen, 30 seconds)
2. Indigenous filmmaker footage of community life
3. Contemporary indigenous voices with their visual choices
4. NO Western imagery in opening

### Documenting Extraction (Throughout)

**Visual Evidence Progression:**

1. Show book covers/museum facades as extraction sites
2. Brief flash of Wasson article with immediate consequence
3. Empty museum cases after repatriation
4. Patent documents with indigenous response
5. Always follow extraction with resistance

### Contemporary Resistance (Final third)

**Center Liberation:**

1. Indigenous conferences and gatherings
2. Youth cultural preservation
3. Legal victories and celebrations
4. Land back movements
5. Community healing initiatives

## Technical Specifications

### Color and Treatment

**DO:**

- Natural, respectful color representation
- Let indigenous footage set visual tone
- Use indigenous artists' color choices
- Maintain documentary authenticity

**DON'T:**

- No "mystical" color grading
- No psychedelic effects on indigenous content
- No artificial aging for "ancient wisdom"
- No orientalist or exotic filters

### Editing Principles

**Rhythm and Pacing:**

- Follow indigenous storytelling patterns where known
- Allow silence and contemplation
- Quick cuts for colonial imagery
- Longer holds on indigenous creation
- Resist spectacle and sensationalism

### Typography and Graphics

**Text Treatment:**

- Indigenous languages first (with permission)
- Simple, respectful fonts
- No "tribal" or orientalist typography
- Credits that center indigenous contributors
- Subtitles that preserve indigenous terms

## Alternative Visual Solutions

### For Sacred/Restricted Content

**Animation/Illustration:**

- Commission indigenous artists
- Abstract representation of concepts
- Metaphorical rather than literal
- Respectful symbolic language

**Text Cards:**

```markdown
"This ceremony cannot be shown.
The sacred remains with the community."

"We respect the boundary between
public knowledge and sacred practice."
```

**Audio Over Black:**

- Indigenous voices describing what cannot be shown
- Explanation of visual sovereignty
- Testimony without image

### For Historical Context

**Archival Alternatives:**

- Show book spines rather than content
- Museum exteriors rather than collections
- Headlines about harm rather than images
- Maps showing extraction routes

## Production Partnerships

### Primary Collaborations

1. **MAHKU Movement** - Through Carmo Johnson Projects
2. **Indigenous Film Festivals** - For filmmaker connections
3. **Native American Rights Fund** - Legal documentation
4. **Visual Sovereignty Movement** - Photography resources
5. **Community Cultural Centers** - Direct partnerships

### Compensation Framework

- **Minimum 30%** of visual budget to indigenous creators
- **Ongoing royalties** for continued use
- **Community funds** for cultural preservation
- **Training opportunities** for indigenous youth
- **Equipment access** for community documentation

## Legal and Ethical Compliance

### Fair Use Application

Problematic materials used only for:

- Criticism of colonial practices
- Educational commentary on extraction
- Transformative analysis of power
- Documentary evidence of harm

### Rights Management

- No payments to colonial institutions for their archives
- Payments to indigenous communities when using their materials
- Clear documentation of permission chains
- Explicit statement of critical purpose
- Community review before release

## Quality Control Checklist

For EVERY visual element, ask:

✓ **Whose gaze does this serve?**

- Indigenous community or Western viewer?

✓ **What power dynamics are reinforced?**

- Does this support sovereignty or extraction?

✓ **Is this ours to show?**

- Do we have explicit permission?
- Are we respecting stated boundaries?

✓ **What is the impact?**

- Could this enable appropriation?
- Does this serve community interests?

✓ **Is absence more powerful?**

- Should we explain what we cannot show?
- Is restraint the ethical choice?

## Final Recommendations

### Visual Priorities

1. **70% indigenous-created content minimum**
2. **20% critical documentation of resistance**
3. **10% maximum extraction evidence (heavily critiqued)**
4. **0% neutral colonial documentation**

### Partnership Requirements

- Long-term relationships, not extraction
- Community review at every stage
- Indigenous final cut approval
- Transparent revenue sharing
- Ongoing support beyond project

### Success Metrics

- Indigenous communities feel accurately represented
- Sacred boundaries completely respected
- Extraction patterns clearly exposed
- Sovereignty narrative centered throughout
- Visual beauty never overrides ethics

## Conclusion

The visual language of this project must embody complete commitment to indigenous sovereignty. Every frame is an opportunity to either perpetuate or challenge colonial ways of seeing. We choose:

- **Creation over documentation**
- **Sovereignty over spectacle**
- **Absence over appropriation**
- **Context over beauty**
- **Liberation over extraction**

This framework ensures our visual choices align with our decolonial research methodology, creating a unified project that serves indigenous communities rather than extracting from them.
