## Implementation Checklist

### For Every Visual Element

✓ **Source Verification**

- Is this indigenous-created or approved?
- Do we have explicit permission?
- Are benefits flowing to community?
- Is attribution clear and correct?

✓ **Ethical Review**

- Does this respect stated boundaries?
- Is sacred content protected?
- Is context adequate?
- Could this enable harm?

✓ **Community Accountability**

- Has community reviewed this?
- Is ongoing relationship maintained?
- Are promises being kept?
- Is feedback incorporated?

✓ **Impact Assessment**

- Does this support sovereignty?
- Does this challenge extraction?
- Does this educate appropriately?
- Does this prevent appropriation?

## Conclusion

Community-approved visual materials exist in abundance when we prioritize indigenous creation and genuine collaboration. The key is not finding imagery to extract, but building relationships that allow communities to share their own visual narratives on their own terms. Every visual choice must serve indigenous sovereignty and community benefit, never extraction or exoticization.

This approach requires more time, resources, and relationship-building than conventional documentary production, but it is the only ethical path forward. The visual beauty and power that emerges from community-controlled representation far exceeds anything that could be extracted or appropriated.
