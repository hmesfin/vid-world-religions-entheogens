## Conclusion

This production resource guide provides practical tools for implementing our ethical framework. Every decision must prioritize indigenous sovereignty, community benefit, and liberation from colonial extraction. The additional time, resources, and relationship-building required by this approach are not obstacles but essential elements of ethical production.

The goal is not just to create a video about these issues, but to model a different way of creating media—one that refuses extraction and centers sovereignty at every step.
