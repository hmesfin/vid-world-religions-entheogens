# Visual Materials: Ethical Framework and Guidelines

## Critical Foundation

Visual representation carries immense power in perpetuating or challenging colonial narratives. Every image choice either reinforces extraction patterns or supports indigenous sovereignty. There is no neutral visual language when documenting sacred traditions and their colonial appropriation.

## Core Principles

### 1. Visual Sovereignty

Indigenous communities have the right to control how they and their traditions are visually represented. This means:

- Using indigenous-created imagery whenever possible
- Respecting photography taboos and sacred image restrictions
- Obtaining explicit permission for any visual representation
- Allowing communities to review and veto visual materials

### 2. Anti-Exoticization

Reject visual languages that perpetuate colonial fantasies:

- No "mystical native" imagery
- No decontextualized ceremonial photographs
- No romanticized "pristine tradition" narratives
- No "psychedelic" aesthetic overlays on indigenous practices

### 3. Context Over Spectacle

Every image must serve the narrative of sovereignty and liberation:

- Historical context over aesthetic appeal
- Community daily life over ceremonial spectacle
- Contemporary struggles over timeless tradition
- Structural analysis over individual experiences

## Categories of Visual Materials

### Category A: Indigenous-Created (CENTER)

**What to seek:**

- Art created by indigenous artists about their own traditions
- Community-produced documentary footage
- Indigenous photographers documenting their communities
- Traditional artistic expressions (with permission)
- Contemporary indigenous visual activism

**Examples:**

- MAHKU movement (Huni Kuin artists)
- Shipibo textile patterns (with context)
- Indigenous filmmaker productions
- Community protest documentation
- Traditional art in museums (with critical context)

**Requirements:**

- Proper attribution and compensation
- Context about artist and community
- Permission for use in this specific context
- Respect for any restrictions on display

### Category B: Historical Documentation (CRITICAL USE)

**What might be used with heavy critique:**

- Colonial-era photographs (to show extraction)
- Museum collection images (to show appropriation)
- Academic expedition footage (to expose colonial science)
- Tourist materials (to demonstrate commodification)
- Medical/clinical imagery (to show reductionism)

**Requirements:**

- Must be framed as evidence of colonialism
- Cannot be presented as neutral documentation
- Need critical commentary on power dynamics
- Should show harm and extraction patterns

### Category C: Contemporary Extraction (EVIDENCE OF HARM)

**Documentation of ongoing colonialism:**

- Retreat center marketing materials
- Conference footage excluding indigenous voices
- Patent documentation imagery
- Clinical trial photographs
- Tourism promotional materials

**Requirements:**

- Used only to expose ongoing extraction
- Paired with indigenous counter-narratives
- Clearly marked as problematic
- Brief exposure to make point

### Category D: Prohibited Imagery (COMPLETE REJECTION)

**Never use:**

- Sacred ceremonies without explicit permission
- Deceased persons in ceremonial contexts
- Secret or restricted ritual objects
- Images that could enable appropriation
- Anything that violates stated community protocols
- AI-generated "indigenous" imagery
- Stock photos of "shamans" or ceremonies
- Psychedelic art appropriating indigenous motifs

## Visual Narrative Strategies

### Opening Sequence

- Begin with indigenous-created art/imagery
- Establish visual sovereignty immediately
- Avoid Western gaze from start

### Documenting Extraction

- Use split screens: indigenous reality vs. Western representation
- Show books/museums as extraction sites
- Contrast community footage with tourist materials

### Contemporary Resistance

- Center protest and activism footage
- Indigenous youth with traditional elders
- Legal documents as visual violence
- Community organizing imagery

### Sacred Boundaries

- Use animation or illustration for restricted content
- Text cards explaining what cannot be shown
- Respectful absence as powerful statement

## Technical Considerations

### Color Grading

- Avoid "mystical" color treatments
- No artificial aging for "ancient wisdom" effect
- Natural, respectful color representation
- Let indigenous footage set visual tone

### Editing Rhythm

- Follow indigenous storytelling patterns where known
- Avoid Western documentary conventions that exoticize
- Allow silence and contemplation
- Resist spectacle and sensationalism

### Typography and Graphics

- Use indigenous languages where appropriate (with permission)
- Avoid "tribal" fonts or orientalist design
- Simple, respectful text treatments
- Credits that center indigenous contributors

## Evaluation Questions for Every Image

1. **Whose gaze does this serve?**
   - Indigenous community or Western viewer?
   - Liberation or consumption?

2. **What power dynamics are reinforced?**
   - Does this support sovereignty?
   - Does this perpetuate extraction?

3. **Is this ours to show?**
   - Do we have explicit permission?
   - Are we respecting stated boundaries?

4. **What is the impact?**
   - Could this enable appropriation?
   - Does this serve community interests?

5. **Is absence more powerful?**
   - Should we explain what we cannot show?
   - Is restraint the ethical choice?

## Legal and Practical Considerations

### Rights and Permissions

- Written permission from individuals shown
- Community protocols beyond individual consent
- Fair use applies to critique of colonial materials
- Attribution and compensation requirements

### Archival Materials

- Colonial archives as evidence, not authority
- Museum permissions with critical framework
- Historical footage rights and restrictions
- Government/military footage considerations

### Contemporary Documentation

- Protest footage rights
- News footage licensing
- Social media content permissions
- Community-generated content agreements

## The Visual Refusal

Just as we refuse Western academic authority, we refuse:

- The colonial gaze
- Extraction through imagery
- Spectacle over sovereignty
- Aesthetics over ethics
- Documentation over dignity

We commit to:

- Visual sovereignty
- Community control
- Respectful absence
- Critical visualization
- Liberation aesthetics

## Conclusion

Every frame is a choice between perpetuating or challenging colonialism. The visual language of this project must embody the same uncompromising commitment to indigenous sovereignty that guides our research and narrative. When in doubt, we choose absence over appropriation, context over beauty, and liberation over documentation.

*This framework ensures visual materials serve the project's decolonial mission, centering indigenous sovereignty while exposing colonial extraction patterns.*
