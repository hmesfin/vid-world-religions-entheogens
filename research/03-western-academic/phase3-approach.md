# Phase 3: Critical Evaluation of Western Academic Sources

## Approach and Methodology

Phase 3 applies the critical frameworks developed in Phase 2 to evaluate Western academic sources on entheogens and world religions. We approach these sources not to center them, but to:
1. Understand and expose extraction patterns
2. Document colonial continuities in contemporary scholarship
3. Identify what (if anything) can be salvaged with heavy critique
4. Demonstrate why indigenous voices must be prioritized

## Critical Lenses from Phase 2

### 1. Extraction Analysis (Linda Tuhiwai Smith)
- What knowledge was taken from communities?
- What was given back (if anything)?
- Who profited from this research?
- Were communities harmed by the publication?

### 2. Power Mapping (Walter Mignolo)
- Who controls the narrative?
- Whose authority is assumed?
- What colonial matrix elements are present?
- How is Western supremacy maintained?

### 3. Epistemological Violence (Boaventura de Sousa Santos)
- What indigenous concepts were erased or mistranslated?
- How were spiritual practices reduced to material explanations?
- What exists on the "other side" of the abyssal line?
- What cognitive injustices occurred?

### 4. Colonial Continuity (Talal Asad)
- How do current frameworks perpetuate colonial control?
- What power dynamics shape "cultural translation"?
- How does academic authority override community knowledge?
- What institutional interests are served?

### 5. Liberation Potential (Faye Harrison)
- Does this serve community sovereignty?
- Could this research support liberation?
- What structural changes are avoided?
- Whose freedom is centered?

## Categories of Western Sources to Evaluate

### Category A: "Foundational" Extraction (1950s-1970s)
Sources that initiated Western academic/popular interest through extraction:

**R. Gordon Wasson**
- *The Road to Eleusis* (1978)
- *Soma: Divine Mushroom of Immortality* (1968)
- Life Magazine article on María Sabina (1957)
- Evaluation focus: Direct harm to indigenous communities

**Albert Hofmann**
- *LSD: My Problem Child* (1979)
- Scientific extraction of compounds from sacred plants
- Evaluation focus: Reduction of spiritual to chemical

**Richard Evans Schultes**
- *Plants of the Gods* (with Hofmann)
- Ethnobotanical "discoveries"
- Evaluation focus: Academic claiming of indigenous knowledge

**Carlos Castaneda**
- *The Teachings of Don Juan* series
- Fabricated/appropriated indigenous narratives
- Evaluation focus: Damage through misrepresentation

### Category B: "Psychedelic Renaissance" Extraction (1990s-present)
Contemporary repetition of colonial patterns:

**Rick Strassman**
- *DMT: The Spirit Molecule*
- Medical model overriding spiritual frameworks
- Evaluation focus: Reductionism and authority claims

**Dennis McKenna, Terence McKenna**
- Various works on ayahuasca and mushrooms
- "Heroic dose" individualism vs. community practice
- Evaluation focus: Decontextualization and commodification

**Michael Pollan**
- *How to Change Your Mind*
- Mainstreaming without indigenous acknowledgment
- Evaluation focus: Erasure and commercial extraction

**Robin Carhart-Harris**
- Neuroscientific reductionism
- "Discovering" what indigenous people knew
- Evaluation focus: Academic authority over traditional knowledge

### Category C: Anthropological Documentation
Academic studies of indigenous practices:

**Marlene Dobkin de Rios**
- Studies of ayahuasca use
- Early feminist perspectives but still extractive
- Evaluation focus: Power dynamics in research

**Benny Shanon**
- *Antipodes of the Mind*
- Cognitive science approach to ayahuasca
- Evaluation focus: Reduction of spiritual to psychological

**Stephan Beyer**
- *Singing to the Plants*
- Detailed documentation of practices
- Evaluation focus: Appropriateness of public documentation

### Category D: Religious Studies Approaches

**Huston Smith**
- *Cleansing the Doors of Perception*
- Perennialist reduction of diversity
- Evaluation focus: Universalizing vs. respecting difference

**William A. Richards**
- *Sacred Knowledge*
- Psychedelics in religious context
- Evaluation focus: Christian supremacy in framing

**Various edited volumes**
- Academic conferences excluding indigenous voices
- Evaluation focus: Whose voices are centered?

## Evaluation Framework for Each Source

### 1. Historical Context
- When was this written?
- What colonial/legal context existed?
- What power did the author hold?
- What access did they have and how?

### 2. Extraction Documentation
- Specific communities affected
- Knowledge taken without permission
- Commercial or academic profit
- Ongoing harm to communities

### 3. Reductionism Analysis
- Spiritual → Chemical
- Community → Individual
- Sacred → Recreational
- Complex → Simple

### 4. Authority Claims
- "Discovery" narratives
- Expertise over practitioners
- Universal explanations
- Dismissal of indigenous frameworks

### 5. Contemporary Impact
- How this work affects current discourse
- Influence on policy and law
- Impact on "psychedelic renaissance"
- Contribution to ongoing extraction

## What We're NOT Doing

This is not about:
- Validating Western scholarship
- Finding "good" Western academics
- Balancing indigenous and Western views
- Being "fair" to extractive research
- Academic courtesy or collegiality

This IS about:
- Exposing ongoing colonial patterns
- Documenting harm to communities
- Showing why Western frameworks fail
- Demonstrating need for indigenous sovereignty
- Supporting liberation over inclusion

## Expected Outcomes

### Sources for Heavy Critique
- May contain useful data (dates, locations, chemical information)
- Must be contextualized within extraction history
- Cannot be presented as authoritative
- Require explicit power analysis

### Sources to Reject Entirely
- Fabrications and misrepresentations (Castaneda)
- Purely extractive with no redeeming value
- Active harm to communities
- Commercial exploitation narratives

### Patterns to Document
- Consistent erasure of indigenous authority
- Reduction of spiritual to material
- Individual focus over community
- "Discovery" and expertise claims
- Profit without reciprocity

## Guiding Questions for Phase 3

1. **The Sabina Test**: Would María Sabina approve of this work, knowing what happened to her community?

2. **The Sovereignty Test**: Does this support indigenous control over their own traditions?

3. **The Liberation Test**: Does this advance community liberation or academic careers?

4. **The Reciprocity Test**: What did communities receive in return for this knowledge?

5. **The Future Test**: Does this create conditions for continued extraction or for indigenous sovereignty?

## Note on Tone

We will not adopt academic politeness that obscures violence. We will:
- Name extraction as extraction
- Call out harm directly
- Refuse false equivalencies
- Center community impact over academic reputation
- Prioritize truth over comfort

This phase exposes the colonial machinery of Western academic engagement with entheogens, not to reform it but to demonstrate why it must be refused in favor of indigenous sovereignty and community control.

*This approach follows from Phase 2's decolonial frameworks and refuses to compromise on the project's commitment to epistemic justice and indigenous sovereignty.*
