# Extraction Patterns and Colonial Continuities: Phase 3 Synthesis

## Executive Summary

Phase 3 analysis reveals that Western academic engagement with entheogens operates as a continuous colonial project spanning seven decades. From Wasson's initial extraction through today's "psychedelic renaissance," every major Western source examined perpetuates the same fundamental patterns: extraction without reciprocity, erasure of indigenous authority, reduction of spiritual to material, and profit flowing to extractors while harm flows to communities.

## The María Sabina Standard

María Sabina's experience establishes the benchmark for measuring extraction violence:
- **Before Wasson**: Respected healer in her community
- **After Wasson**: Died in poverty, ostracized, her community disrupted by tourism
- **The Pattern**: Every subsequent Western source contributes to this same dynamic

When we ask "Would María Sabina approve?" the answer for every Western source is definitively NO.

## Documented Extraction Patterns

### 1. The "Discovery" Narrative
**Pattern**: Western academics claim to "discover" what indigenous peoples have known for millennia

**Examples**:
- Wasson "discovers" psilocybin mushrooms (Mazatec: thousands of years of use)
- Schultes "discovers" ayahuasca combinations (Indigenous: ancestral knowledge)
- Carhart-Harris "discovers" default mode network effects (Shamans: ego dissolution teachings)

**Impact**: Indigenous knowledge only becomes "real" when validated by Western science

### 2. Authority Transfer
**Pattern**: Traditional practitioners replaced by Western "experts"

**Progression**:
- 1950s: Anthropologists become authorities on indigenous practices
- 1970s: Chemists become authorities on plant medicines
- 1990s: "Psychonauts" become authorities on consciousness
- 2020s: Medical doctors become authorities on healing

**Result**: Communities that originated practices excluded from their own traditions

### 3. Reduction Cascade
**Pattern**: Complex spiritual ecologies reduced to consumable products

**Reductions documented**:
- Plant teachers → psychoactive compounds
- Community ceremonies → individual sessions
- Sacred relationships → therapeutic interventions
- Ecological wisdom → extraction techniques
- Spiritual transformation → neuroplasticity

**Consequence**: Living traditions become dead commodities

### 4. Profit Inversion
**Pattern**: Value flows from communities to extractors

**Financial flows**:
- Indigenous communities: Provide knowledge, receive poverty
- Western academics: Extract knowledge, receive careers
- Publishers: Package extraction, receive profits
- Pharmaceutical companies: Patent traditions, receive monopolies
- Tourism industry: Commodify ceremonies, receive revenues

**Current example**: Compass Pathways attempts to patent psilocybin therapy methods traditional healers have used for centuries

### 5. Harm Concentration
**Pattern**: Negative impacts concentrate in originating communities

**Documented harms**:
- Cultural disruption (tourist invasions)
- Economic dependency (forced into tourism economy)
- Environmental degradation (over-harvesting)
- Social fragmentation (traditional authority undermined)
- Spiritual violence (sacred knowledge commodified)

## Colonial Continuities

### From Direct to Sophisticated Extraction

**1950s-1970s: Direct Extraction**
- Physical removal of plants and knowledge
- Museum collection building
- Explicit "discovery" claims
- Open disregard for indigenous authority

**1990s-2000s: Commercial Extraction**
- Knowledge packaged for mass consumption
- Retreat industry establishment
- "Psychonaut" individualism
- Indigenous imagery appropriated

**2010s-Present: Medical Extraction**
- Clinical trials using traditional knowledge
- Patent attempts on ancient practices
- Insurance-covered treatments excluding traditional healers
- "Mental health crisis" narrative justifying extraction

### The Psychedelic Renaissance as Colonial Project

The current "renaissance" represents not progress but sophisticated colonialism:

**Surface changes**:
- More "respectful" language
- Token indigenous inclusion
- Acknowledgment of origins (without structural change)
- "Reciprocity" rhetoric (without actual reciprocity)

**Structural continuities**:
- Western institutions control research
- Indigenous communities remain criminalized
- Profits flow to Western companies
- Traditional healers excluded from medical systems
- Academic authority supersedes community knowledge

## What Can Be Salvaged (With Heavy Critique)

### Limited Salvageable Data

**Botanical/Chemical Information**:
- Plant identification (when accurately documented)
- Chemical compound structures (contextualized as reductions)
- Geographic distributions (acknowledging sacred site violations)
- Historical dates (of extraction events)

**Requirements for use**:
1. Must be prefaced with extraction critique
2. Indigenous sources must be prioritized
3. Context of harm must be acknowledged
4. Cannot be presented as authoritative

### Useful as Evidence of Harm

These sources are most valuable as documentation of colonial violence:
- Wasson documents destruction of Mazatec community
- Castaneda demonstrates academic complicity with fraud
- Pollan reveals mainstream extraction mechanisms
- All provide evidence for reparations arguments

## Complete Rejections

### Sources with No Salvageable Value

**Carlos Castaneda**: Complete fabrication causing ongoing harm through misrepresentation

**Most neuroscience papers**: Reductionism so complete that no useful knowledge remains

**Tourism promotion materials**: Pure commercial extraction

**Patent applications**: Legal violence against traditional knowledge

### Why Rejection Is Necessary

Not about:
- Academic courtesy
- Balanced perspectives
- Finding middle ground
- Reforming bad practices

But about:
- Exposing structural violence
- Supporting indigenous sovereignty
- Refusing colonial frameworks
- Centering community liberation

## Implications for Video Production

### What This Means for Our Approach

**Cannot use Western sources as**:
- Primary authorities
- Neutral information
- Balanced perspectives
- Scientific validation

**Must use Western sources as**:
- Evidence of extraction
- Examples of what not to do
- Context for indigenous resistance
- Documentation of ongoing colonialism

### Narrative Implications

The video must:
1. Open with indigenous voices defining the problem
2. Show Western extraction as continuation of colonialism
3. Refuse false balance between extractors and communities
4. Center liberation over inclusion
5. Support sovereignty over reform

## The Liberation Imperative

### Beyond Critique to Transformation

Documenting extraction is not enough. The video must actively support:

**Indigenous Sovereignty**:
- Communities control their own knowledge
- Traditional practitioners recognized as primary authorities
- Sacred boundaries respected absolutely
- Economic benefits flow to communities

**Structural Change**:
- End criminalization of traditional practices
- Dismantle patent systems claiming traditional knowledge
- Redirect research funding to community-controlled projects
- Support indigenous-led healing systems

**Epistemic Justice**:
- Traditional knowledge systems recognized as complete
- Western science as one way of knowing, not THE way
- Community validation over peer review
- Sacred dimensions acknowledged as real

## Conclusion: The Refusal

Phase 3 analysis leads to a fundamental refusal:

We refuse to:
- Present Western sources as authorities
- Balance extraction with token acknowledgment
- Reform colonial systems through inclusion
- Separate knowledge from its sacred context
- Continue the extraction through documentation

We commit to:
- Centering indigenous voices absolutely
- Exposing colonial violence directly
- Supporting community sovereignty completely
- Respecting sacred boundaries unconditionally
- Serving liberation uncompromisingly

This is not about finding better Western scholars or more ethical extraction methods. This is about recognizing that the entire Western academic approach to entheogens is a colonial project that must be refused in favor of indigenous sovereignty and community control.
