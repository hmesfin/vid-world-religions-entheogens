# Phase 2: Critical and Decolonial Scholarship Research Plan

## Research Questions for Phase 2

### Epistemological Questions

1. How do decolonial frameworks help us understand indigenous uses of entheogens?
2. What are the alternatives to Western academic ways of knowing about consciousness?
3. How can we apply concepts like "pluriversality" to religious diversity?

### Methodological Questions

1. How can research serve communities rather than extract from them?
2. What does reciprocal research look like in practice?
3. How do we navigate the tension between documentation and protection of sacred knowledge?

### Critical Questions

1. How has colonialism shaped current prohibitions and attitudes?
2. What role did missionaries play in suppressing traditional practices?
3. How do current academic frameworks perpetuate colonial relationships?

## Search Strategies

### Academic Databases

- Focus on non-Western institutions and journals
- Prioritize open-access materials from Global South
- Look for community-published materials

### Key Terms to Explore

- "Decolonial" + "consciousness" + "spirituality"
- "Indigenous epistemology" + "sacred plants"
- "Cognitive justice" + "traditional knowledge"
- "Pluriversality" + "religious practices"
- "Border thinking" + "mysticism"

### Alternative Sources

- Indigenous universities and knowledge centers
- Community-based research organizations
- Oral history projects
- Practitioner-scholar networks

## Output Goals for Phase 2

1. **Theoretical Framework Document**
   - Decolonial concepts applicable to our topic
   - Alternative epistemologies for understanding consciousness
   - Critique of Western academic approaches

2. **Methodological Reflection**
   - How these theories inform our approach
   - What we need to unlearn from Western frameworks
   - How to apply decolonial methods to video production

3. **Critical Analysis Matrix**
   - Mapping colonial influences on current laws/attitudes
   - Identifying epistemic violence in academic literature
   - Finding spaces for indigenous resurgence

4. **Scholar Network Map**
   - Connections between decolonial thinkers
   - Indigenous scholar networks
   - Community-based knowledge producers

## Ethical Considerations for Phase 2

- Even critical scholarship can be extractive if not handled carefully
- Prioritize scholars from affected communities
- Acknowledge when we're using Western-trained scholars' interpretations
- Be explicit about which frameworks we're applying and why
- Consider how decolonial theory itself can become academic abstraction

## Timeline

**Week 1**: Decolonial theorists and frameworks
**Week 2**: Critical anthropology and methodology
**Week 3**: Non-Western religious scholars
**Week 4**: Synthesis and application to project
