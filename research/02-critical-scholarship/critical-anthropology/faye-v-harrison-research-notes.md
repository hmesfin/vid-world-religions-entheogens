## Historical Context and Origins

### 1987 Association of Black Anthropologists Session

**Origin Story:** The seminal "Decolonizing Anthropology" volume emerged from the first invited session for the Association of Black Anthropologists at the American Anthropological Association conference in 1987.

**Ahead of Its Time:** Published in 1991, the work was "so ahead of its time" - introducing concepts of decolonization that wouldn't become mainstream in anthropology for decades.

**Foundational Impact:** The book has influenced generations of anthropologists and remains a fundamental text in critical anthropological theory.

## Core Arguments for Decolonizing Anthropology

### 1. Transformation as Central Mission

**Key Quote:** "To encourage more anthropologists to accept the challenge of working to free the study of human kind from the prevailing forces of global inequality, and dehumanization, and to locate it firmly in the complex struggle for genuine transformation."

**Principle:** Anthropology cannot just be about studying people - it must have transformation and making life more bearable for everyone built into its mission.

**Application to Entheogen Studies:**
- Research on sacred plant medicines should serve communities, not just academic careers
- Studies should challenge systems that criminalize traditional practices
- Work should support indigenous sovereignty and self-determination
- Research should contribute to healing from colonial trauma

### 2. Reading Global South Intellectuals

**Methodological Requirement:** Decolonizing anthropology requires reading and incorporating the work of intellectuals from the Global South, understanding that this literature has a long history.

**Impact:** This challenges the dominance of Western theoretical frameworks and centers alternative ways of knowing.

**Application to Entheogen Studies:**
- Prioritize indigenous and Global South scholars on plant medicines
- Include works by traditional healers and knowledge keepers
- Center non-Western understandings of consciousness, healing, and plant relationships
- Challenge Western psychedelic research dominance

### 3. Intersectional Analysis

**Focus:** Understanding "the impact of the intersections of race, class, and gender on cultural consciousness and colonial discourse."

**Black Feminist Framework:** Draws on the work of earlier generations of Black feminists, including Black lesbian feminists like Audre Lorde and Barbara Smith.

**Application to Entheogen Studies:**
- Examine how race, gender, and class affect access to plant medicines
- Analyze how colonial discourse has shaped understanding of indigenous practices
- Consider how criminalization disproportionately affects communities of color
- Include perspectives of women and gender-diverse plant medicine practitioners

## The "Outsider Within" Perspective

### 1. Patricia Hill Collins' Concept Applied

**Definition:** Building on the concept of marginality and being "betwixt and between," the "outsider within" describes people who are inside institutions but never fully belong.

**Academic Context:** Even after earning PhDs, members of marginalized communities remain "outsiders within" - a position that is both a privilege and an experience of continued marginalization.

**Epistemological Advantage:** Outsiders within are "privy to things that happen that are usually hidden to people who are not part of that club, family, or discipline."

**Application to Entheogen Studies:**
- Indigenous anthropologists studying their own plant medicine traditions
- Scholars of color in predominantly white psychedelic research spaces
- Traditional healers working within Western academic or clinical contexts
- Community members who become researchers of their own practices

### 2. Hidden Knowledge Access

**Renato Rosaldo's Observation:** "People of color in subservient roles have been inside the halls and homes of privileged white people, knowing much about them that they do not know about marginalized communities."

**Application to Entheogen Studies:**
- Indigenous people understand both their traditional practices and Western attempts to study them
- Communities affected by drug war policies understand both traditional use and criminalization
- Practitioners know the limitations and blind spots of Western research approaches

## Methodological Innovations

### 1. Robust Ethnographic Engagement

**Beyond Surface Methods:** Harrison emphasizes that anthropological ethnography requires much more than "summer fieldwork with observations and interviews."

**Deep Engagement:** Proper ethnographic study requires "lots of different things" and sustained engagement with "the texture, the flux, the oomph" of people's lives.

**Dialogical Approach:** Values "dialogues with people, treating them as people" rather than research subjects.

**Application to Entheogen Studies:**
- Long-term engagement with plant medicine communities
- Participatory research methods that center community priorities
- Recognition of the full complexity of traditional healing systems
- Building genuine relationships rather than extractive research encounters

### 2. Coalitional Networks

**Knowledge Sharing:** Building networks that allow sharing of "various kinds of knowledge - those generated through routine academic work, NGO activities, and sustained activist practice in 'the trenches of struggle.'"

**Community-Academic Bridge:** Connecting academic knowledge with activist and community-based knowledge.

**Application to Entheogen Studies:**
- Networks connecting researchers, traditional healers, and activists
- Collaborative projects between universities and indigenous communities
- Integration of academic research with drug policy reform activism
- Bridging clinical research with traditional healing wisdom

### 3. Alternative Knowledge Spaces

**Post Core-Periphery Vision:** Harrison imagines "an alternative space as a post core-periphery setting, a democratized and decolonized environment."

**Crossroads of Knowledge:** Diverse anthropologists and thinkers coming together where hierarchical ordering of knowledge is challenged.

**Application to Entheogen Studies:**
- Research spaces where traditional and scientific knowledge have equal authority
- Conferences and publications that center indigenous voices
- Clinical trials designed in partnership with traditional healers
- Academic programs that incorporate indigenous plant medicine education

## Addressing White Supremacy in Academia

### 1. Structural Analysis

**White Supremacy Recognition:** Harrison's work specifically addresses how anthropology must confront issues of white supremacy and center marginalized communities.

**Institutional Change:** Focus on "long-term, structural change in academic spaces, especially universities and professional organizations."

**Application to Entheogen Studies:**
- Examining how white supremacy operates in psychedelic research
- Challenging the dominance of white researchers in plant medicine studies
- Addressing racial disparities in psychedelic therapy access
- Supporting scholars and practitioners of color in the field

### 2. Black Lives Matter Lessons

**Key Lessons:** "(1) Disruption, protest, resistance, and rebellion are necessary in order to decolonize spaces and institutions; and (2) Black/African diasporic women often play pivotal leadership roles in these successful strategies."

**Application to Entheogen Studies:**
- Supporting activist challenges to drug criminalization
- Recognizing leadership of women of color in drug policy reform
- Disrupting extractive research practices in psychedelic studies
- Challenging institutional racism in clinical psychedelic research

## Critical Race Feminist Methodology

### 1. Global Research Tool

**Methodology:** "Critical race feminist methodology as a tool for global research" - examining how race, gender, and power operate across different contexts.

**Intersectional Framework:** Understanding how multiple systems of oppression interact.

**Application to Entheogen Studies:**
- Analyzing how colonialism, racism, and sexism affect plant medicine access
- Examining gender dynamics in traditional healing systems
- Understanding how drug policies impact different communities differently
- Researching cross-cultural experiences of plant medicine healing

### 2. Historical Precedents

**Manet Fowler Example:** The first Black woman to earn a PhD in anthropology in the US faced challenges for doing participatory action research to empower communities - considered "too radical and unscientific" in the early 1970s.

**Contemporary Relevance:** Shows how participatory and community-empowering approaches have long been marginalized in academia.

**Application to Entheogen Studies:**
- Supporting community-controlled research on plant medicines
- Validating participatory action research approaches
- Challenging academic gatekeeping around "proper" research methods
- Recognizing community expertise as scientifically valid

## Key Concepts for Respectful Entheogen Research

### 1. Full Humanity Recognition

**Principle:** "Taking the subaltern, the indigenous, the indigenized and the minoritized seriously, recognizing people's full humanity, their wisdom, intelligence, and capacity to produce forms of knowledge."

**Application:** Recognizing traditional healers and indigenous practitioners as knowledge producers, not just research subjects.

### 2. Liberation-Oriented Research

**Goal:** Research should contribute to "genuine transformation" and work toward "an anthropology for liberation."

**Practice:** All research should be evaluated on whether it serves the interests of marginalized communities or reinforces existing power structures.

### 3. Restructuring Intellectual Authority

**Change Required:** "New research questions will reflect the restructuring of intellectual authority that decolonizing practices demand."

**Academic Revolution:** Fundamental changes to who is considered an authority and what counts as valid knowledge.

## Key Quotes for Project Application

1. **On Transformation:** "To encourage more anthropologists to accept the challenge of working to free the study of human kind from the prevailing forces of global inequality, and dehumanization, and to locate it firmly in the complex struggle for genuine transformation."

2. **On Knowledge Production:** "Taking the subaltern, the indigenous, the indigenized and the minoritized seriously, recognizing people's full humanity, their wisdom, intelligence, and capacity to produce forms of knowledge."

3. **On Outsider Within:** "Even after earning PhDs, members of these communities never fully belong, remaining 'outsiders within' - a position that is both a privilege and an experience of continued marginalization."

4. **On Methodology:** Proper ethnography requires engagement with "the texture, the flux, the oomph of their lives" through "dialogues with people, treating them as people."

## Application to World Religions and Entheogen Project

### What This Means for Our Approach

1. **Center Black and Indigenous Voices:** Prioritize scholars, practitioners, and knowledge holders from marginalized communities, especially Black and Indigenous people.

2. **Transformation Focus:** Ensure research serves liberation goals - supporting decriminalization, indigenous sovereignty, and healing from colonial trauma.

3. **Intersectional Analysis:** Examine how race, gender, class, and colonialism intersect in plant medicine criminalization and access.

4. **Coalitional Networks:** Build relationships between academic researchers, traditional healers, activists, and affected communities.

5. **Challenge White Supremacy:** Actively work against the dominance of white researchers and Western frameworks in psychedelic studies.

6. **Alternative Knowledge Spaces:** Create platforms where traditional knowledge has equal authority with Western science.

### Specific Applications

1. **Research Methodology:** Use participatory action research that empowers communities rather than extractive academic approaches.

2. **Knowledge Sources:** Prioritize works by Black, Indigenous, and Global South scholars on consciousness, healing, and plant medicines.

3. **Historical Analysis:** Examine how racism and colonialism shaped the criminalization of traditional plant medicines.

4. **Contemporary Focus:** Document how marginalized communities are affected by and resist current drug policies.
