- **Type:** Indigenous Community Voice - Direct Critique from Affected Communities

## Evaluation

### Voice and Perspective
- **Whose voice is this?** Indigenous scholar and activist speaking from within the communities most affected by anthropological study
- **What is their relationship to the tradition discussed?** Member of Native American community that has been subject to extensive anthropological research and extraction
- **What authority do they have to speak on this topic?** Ultimate authority as representative of communities being studied; lived experience of anthropological extraction; legal and academic training to articulate critique

### Colonial/Power Analysis
- **Historical context of production:** Written during height of civil rights movement and Red Power activism (1969); period of increasing indigenous sovereignty assertions
- **Power dynamics involved:** Indigenous intellectual challenging white academic establishment; community member speaking back to outside researchers
- **Potential biases or limitations:** Focused primarily on North American context; some generalizations about anthropologists; less engagement with potential for reformed anthropological practice

### Community Alignment
- **Does this align with community understanding?** Definitive community voice - represents widespread indigenous frustration with anthropological extraction
- **Have communities validated or contested this?** Widely celebrated in indigenous communities; became foundational text for Native American Studies
- **Are there alternative community perspectives?** Some indigenous anthropologists have sought to reform rather than reject the discipline, but Deloria's critique remains widely endorsed

### Usage Decision
- [x] Center this perspective - Essential indigenous critique that must be centered in any discussion of anthropology and indigenous practices
- [ ] Include with critical contextualization
- [ ] Reference but challenge
- [ ] Exclude as inappropriate

## Key Claims and Evidence

### The Anthropologist Curse
> "Indians have been cursed above all other people in history. Indians have anthropologists."

### The Summer Invasion Critique
- Annual influx of researchers treating reservations as laboratories
- Comparison to historical invasions and colonization
- Academic tourism extracting knowledge without reciprocity

### Satirical Deconstruction
Detailed satirical portraits revealing:
- Cultural arrogance of researchers
- Inappropriate methods and assumptions
- Lack of meaningful relationship with communities

### Academic vs. Lived Experience
> "Indians have anthropologists" - captures problem of outside academic expertise being imposed over indigenous knowledge and lived experience

## Application to Entheogen Research

### Direct Applications
1. **Research Tourism**: Modern equivalent in ayahuasca tourism and academic extraction from plant medicine communities
2. **Academic Authority**: Western researchers claiming expertise over indigenous plant medicine traditions
3. **Knowledge Extraction**: Research conducted without meaningful community involvement or benefit-sharing
4. **Misrepresentation**: Academic frameworks imposed on indigenous understanding of plant consciousness

### Contemporary Parallels
- **Summer Invasions**: Researchers descending on indigenous communities during specific seasons
- **Cultural Arrogance**: Assumptions that Western scientific methods are superior to indigenous knowledge systems
- **Patent Issues**: Academic and pharmaceutical institutions claiming intellectual property over traditional knowledge

### Community Impact
- Police harassment and criminalization following academic exposure (parallels María Sabina case)
- Disruption of traditional practices through outside attention
- Loss of control over cultural representations

## Quotes and References

### Foundational Critique
1. **The Curse**: "Into each life, it is said, some rain must fall. Some people have bad horoscopes, others take tips on the stock market. But Indians have been cursed above all other people in history. Indians have anthropologists."

2. **Summer Invasion**: "Every summer when school is out a veritable stream of immigrants heads into Indian country"

3. **Academic Mythology**: "I grew up believing the myth of the objective scientist" - critique of supposed scientific neutrality

### Impact on Discipline
- **Transformational Effect**: "North American anthropology can be divided into two ages: BD and AD—Before and After Deloria"
- **Institutional Change**: Led to increased reflexivity and ethical considerations within anthropology

## Application to Plant Medicine Context

### Historical Parallels
- R. Gordon Wasson's exploitation of María Sabina mirrors patterns Deloria identified
- Academic researchers gaining access through deceptive means
- Knowledge extraction resulting in community harm and criminalization

### Contemporary Issues
- Psychedelic researchers claiming expertise over indigenous plant medicines
- Clinical trials extracting traditional knowledge without community involvement
- Academic conferences discussing indigenous practices without indigenous participation

### Sovereignty Framework
> The challenge is to support indigenous self-determination over plant medicine traditions rather than studying them as academic subjects

- Use to examine power dynamics in contemporary psychedelic research
- Reference when discussing academic authority vs. indigenous knowledge
- Critical for establishing why our project prioritizes community voices over academic interpretations
- Important for understanding ongoing patterns of extraction in psychedelic renaissance
