# Contemporary Movements for Decolonizing Anthropology: Synthesis and Applications

## Introduction

This synthesis document brings together insights from critical anthropologists examining the colonial history of their discipline, with specific focus on applications to contemporary movements for decolonizing anthropology and their relevance to studying entheogens and indigenous spiritual practices.

## Historical Trajectory: From Colonial Anthropology to Decolonial Movements

### Phase 1: Colonial Foundations (Late 19th - Mid 20th Century)
- **Functionalist Period**: Anthropology developed as tool of colonial administration
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Systematic extraction of indigenous knowledge without reciprocity
- **Academic Authority**: Western scholars claimed interpretive authority over indigenous cultures
- **Administrative Utility**: Anthropological categories served colonial control purposes

### Phase 2: Early Critiques (1960s-1970s)
- **Talal Asad (1973)**: "Anthropology and the Colonial Encounter" exposes discipline's colonial foundations
- **Vine Deloria Jr. (1969)**: Indigenous critique challenges academic authority: "Indians have anthropologists"
- **Decolonization Movements**: Global anti-colonial struggles challenge academic complicity

### Phase 3: Transformational Period (1980s-1990s)
- **Faye V. Harrison (1991)**: "Decolonizing Anthropology" establishes liberation framework
- **Cultural Translation Critique**: Asad (1986) exposes power dynamics in anthropological interpretation
- **Writing Culture Movement**: Increased attention to representation and authorship issues

### Phase 4: Contemporary Decolonial Movements (2000s-Present)
- **Ontological Turn**: Recognition of multiple valid ways of understanding reality
- **Community-Controlled Research**: Indigenous communities asserting research sovereignty
- **Collaborative Methodologies**: Development of participatory and reciprocal research approaches

## Key Critical Frameworks and Their Applications

### 1. Talal Asad: Power and Translation

#### Core Framework
> "The process of 'cultural translation' is inevitably enmeshed in conditions of power â€” professional, national, international."

#### Contemporary Applications to Entheogen Research
- **Psychedelic Renaissance Critique**: Modern psychedelic research continues patterns of extractive translation
- **Clinical Translation**: Converting indigenous plant wisdom into Western pharmaceutical frameworks
- **Academic Authority**: Western researchers maintaining interpretive authority over indigenous experiences

#### Methodological Implications
- **Power Analysis**: Examine power dynamics in all cross-cultural interpretation
- **Translation Caution**: Recognize that "translating" indigenous concepts into Western frameworks involves power relationships
- **Institutional Critique**: Challenge academic and clinical institutions' authority over indigenous knowledge

### 2. Vine Deloria Jr.: Indigenous Sovereignty Over Knowledge

#### Core Framework
> "Indians have been cursed above all other people in history. Indians have anthropologists."

#### Contemporary Applications
- **Research Tourism**: Modern equivalent in ayahuasca tourism and academic extraction from plant medicine communities
- **Academic Expertise Problem**: Western researchers claiming expertise over indigenous plant medicines
- **Community Self-Determination**: Indigenous communities asserting control over research about their traditions

#### Impact on Contemporary Practice
- **Institutional Changes**: Increased reflexivity and ethical considerations within anthropology
- **Indigenous Studies Growth**: Development of Native American Studies as alternative to traditional anthropological approaches
- **Community-Controlled Research**: Rise of research conducted by and for indigenous communities

### 3. Faye V. Harrison: Intersectional Liberation Framework

#### Core Framework
Liberation-oriented anthropology addressing intersections of race, class, and gender in both academic practice and community research.

#### Contemporary Applications to Plant Medicine Research
- **Intersectional Analysis**: Understanding how multiple oppressions affect plant medicine communities
- **Black Feminist Perspective**: Recognition of African diaspora plant traditions often excluded from study
- **Economic Justice**: Analysis of exploitation in psychedelic tourism and research

#### Methodological Contributions
- **Community Benefit Focus**: Research serving community liberation rather than academic advancement
- **Structural Analysis**: Understanding plant medicine criminalization within broader systems of oppression
- **Diverse Perspectives**: Challenge to white-dominated academic spaces

### 4. Zora Neale Hurston: Insider Methodology Pioneer

#### Core Framework
> "I had to have the spy-glass of Anthropology to look through at that" - using anthropological tools from insider position

#### Contemporary Applications
- **Practitioner-Researchers**: Supporting community members conducting their own research
- **Insider Training**: Programs preparing community members for research roles
- **Authentic Representation**: Community members representing themselves rather than being represented by outsiders

#### Methodological Innovation
- **Community-Based Participant Observation**: Research as part of ongoing community relationships
- **Cultural Competence**: Understanding through lived experience rather than academic study
- **Reciprocal Relationships**: Research emerging from ongoing community connections

### 5. Eduardo Viveiros de Castro: Ontological Pluralism

#### Core Framework
Amerindian perspectivism: "multinaturalism" where all beings have consciousness but different types of bodies

#### Applications to Plant Medicine Research
- **Plant Agency**: Understanding plants as conscious beings with their own perspectives
- **Shamanic Diplomacy**: Healers as diplomats between human and plant worlds
- **Anti-Reductionism**: Resistance to reducing plant experiences to neurochemical explanations

#### Contemporary Relevance
- **Multiple Realities**: Accept that indigenous and Western understanding may both be valid
- **Interspecies Relations**: Move beyond human-centered research approaches
- **Ontological Respect**: Treat indigenous ontologies as complete worldviews

### 6. Philippe Descola: Beyond Nature/Culture

#### Core Framework
Four ontologies (animism, naturalism, totemism, analogism) challenging Western nature/culture divisions

#### Applications to Plant Research
- **Relational Understanding**: Plants within networks of relationships rather than isolated substances
- **Ontological Diversity**: Different cultures genuinely experience plant-human relationships differently
- **Beyond Western Categories**: Challenge divisions between natural substances and cultural practices

## Contemporary Decolonial Methodologies

### Linda Tuhiwai Smith's Framework
From "Decolonizing Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples":

#### Core Principles
> "Decolonization is concerned with having a more critical understanding of the underlying assumptions, motivations and values that inform research practices."

#### Key Components
1. **Community Control**: "Aboriginal people direct research agendas in culturally appropriate ways as collaborators rather than subjects"
2. **Cultural Appropriateness**: Methods aligned with indigenous worldviews and values
3. **Transformative Goals**: Research aimed at social change rather than just knowledge production

### Ubuntu and Relational Methodologies

#### Ubuntu Framework
> "Ubuntu refers to an African ethic of interdependence and relatedness. Within the precepts of Ubuntu, personhood is understood in relational terms."

#### Research Applications
- **Relational Approach**: "Research 'with' the researched and not of research 'on' them"
- **Trusting Relationships**: Enhanced through recognition of interdependence
- **Community Assets**: Recognition of individual and community strengths

### Participatory Action Research (PAR)

#### Core Features
- **Community Ownership**: Research controlled by and benefiting communities being studied
- **Collaborative Design**: Research questions and methods developed collaboratively
- **Action Orientation**: Research designed to create positive change for communities
- **Knowledge Co-Production**: Academic and community knowledge working together

## Contemporary Challenges in Psychedelic Research

### The New Colonialism
> "Critics find the rush to approve and deploy psychedelics globally problematic, describing it as 'hubristic, profiteering, and colonial.'"

#### Specific Problems
1. **Intellectual Property Issues**: "Current sovereign enclosures, patent laws, and intellectual property rights represent the next iteration in ongoing Western domination"
2. **Knowledge Extraction**: "Indigenous Nations are concerned they are being excluded from psychedelic spaces that extract their knowledge"
3. **Economic Exploitation**: "Burgeoning retreat centers charge thousands of dollars for experiences that culturally appropriate Indigenous traditions yet share few benefits"
4. **Unsustainable Harvesting**: "International demand is driving people to unsustainably harvest iboga, the plants used to make ayahuasca, and peyote"

### Historical Patterns Continuing
- **Academic Authority**: Researchers maintaining interpretive authority over indigenous experiences
- **Clinical Reductionism**: Converting sacred plant medicines into Western therapeutic modalities
- **Community Exclusion**: Research conducted without meaningful community involvement

## Conclusion: Toward Genuine Decolonization

The critical anthropologists examined in this synthesis provide essential frameworks for understanding how academic disciplines can move beyond their colonial foundations. Their work demonstrates that genuine decolonization requires:

1. **Fundamental Power Shifts**: Moving beyond reform to transform relationships between academic institutions and communities
2. **Epistemological Transformation**: Recognizing multiple valid ways of knowing rather than Western academic supremacy  
3. **Community Sovereignty**: Supporting communities' control over research about their own traditions
4. **Structural Change**: Addressing institutional practices that perpetuate extraction and marginalization
5. **Reciprocal Relations**: Developing research relationships that benefit rather than exploit communities

For our World Religions and Entheogens project, these insights provide both a critical lens for evaluating sources and a methodological framework for conducting research that serves rather than extracts from the communities whose wisdom we seek to honor. The goal is not simply to avoid harm, but to actively support community sovereignty, cultural preservation, and spiritual self-determination.

As Faye Harrison noted: "Anthropology is not decolonized today, but I am happy to say there is a critical mass of kindred-thinking people who are doing fantastic work. With every generation maybe we can go a little bit further." Our project aims to contribute to this ongoing transformation by demonstrating how research on sacred topics can be conducted with genuine respect, humility, and commitment to community benefit.
