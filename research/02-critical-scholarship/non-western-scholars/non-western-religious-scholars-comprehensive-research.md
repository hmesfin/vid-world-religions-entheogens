These scholars challenge Western interpretations and offer alternative frameworks for understanding religious experience, including traditional practices with entheogens. Their work demonstrates how indigenous concepts often don't translate to Western frameworks and emphasizes community-based spiritual practices, the relationship between spirituality and liberation, and traditional knowledge systems on their own terms.
